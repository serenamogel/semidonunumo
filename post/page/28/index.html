Property is always a good investment, and, over the years, Scottie Pippen has poured some of his fortune into his homes. Since Pippen got his big break with the Chicago Bulls, it makes sense that some of his major investments would be in the Windy City. In 2021, Pippen sold his Highland Park home for just under $2 million. He had originally bought the home back in 2004, but kept it as an investment property after moving to Los Angeles years later.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Best Man Down Review</h2><time>Jul 4, 2024</time>

Every so often I get asked about what caused me to be interested in GPUs, and consequently how I ended up at AnandTech. The answer to either of those is something of a long story that I rarely go into, but in short it has a lot to do with the history of PC graphics itself, and in particular a very important and very historical piece of software: Second Reality.

[Verse 1]
If you've been walking the same old road for miles and miles
If you've been hearing the same old voice tell the same old lies
If you're trying to fill the same old holes inside
There's a better life, there's a better life[Chorus]
If you've got pain, He's a pain taker
If you feel lost, He's a way maker
If you need freedom or saving, He's a prison-shaking Savior</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Golfer Girl, Bikini Golf etc etc</h2><time>Jul 1, 2024</time>
