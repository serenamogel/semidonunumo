One of those MVPs is Peter Sarsgaard, as the fantastically-named Bartholomew Bogue, the villain of this version. Sarsgaard and Fuqua know to hold nothing back with their characterization of true evil. They practically give him a handlebar mustache to twirl.

In fact, it’s too bad we don’t get more time with Sarsgaard in the center of the film because he understands how to embrace a villain.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Tulsi Gabbard Husband Net Worth 2024</h2><time>Aug 30, 2024</time>

One episode might have a worthless cameo from Stevie Nicks, and the next could send off five characters from the main cast. It’s almost like the writers are only sharing parts of their notes with each others, which makes each episode question my knowledge of the show.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Discovering Solna: 7 Exciting Activities for USA Travelers</h2><time>Aug 29, 2024</time>
