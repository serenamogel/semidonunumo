At this point, we can't really tell if he was being sarcastic or telling the truth but his words can definitely get people crossed with him again. These days, very few celebrities will agree to be mentioned in any sentence next to <strong><a href=#>Kanye West's</a></strong> name, but we have no idea what <strong>Jonah Hill</strong> will think after this. The actor is in fact, <strong>Jewish </strong>and we can't imagine he liked Kanye's recent behavior against his people. But Jonah might feel compromised because he shares a friendship with the rapper.</p><h2 class=ue-c-article__subheadline>Kanye West's unexpected movie night</h2><p>Don't get us wrong, Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum's '21 Jumpstreet' completely revitalized the franchise that Johnny Depp led back in the day. It is without a doubt one of the funniest films of the new century and more people should watch it. But Kanye West commenting on it does come from way over left field. This is what he wrote: "Watching Jonah Hill in 21 Jump Street made me like Jewish people again. No one should talk anger against one or two individuals and transform that into hatred towards millions of innocent people. No Christian can be labeled anti-Semite knowing Jesus is Jew. Thank You Jonah Hill I love you."</p><p>Jonah Hill has no social media right now, so it's difficult to know what he thinks about Kanye West's latest assessment. However, directors Phil Lord and Christipher Miller deinitely are on social media and they kind of took the compliment. As we said before, it's hard to tell when Kanye West is being serious and he is simply joking. Only he understands his sense of humor. Jonah Hill is a big fan but we don't know about the directors though. Trying to understand what Kanye meant, Jonah Hill has always tried to be up to date with urban culture. Perhaps that's what made Kanye realize in his mind that not all Jewish people are bad.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3RnJhnm5%2BifKa6jqWgn52jqcatsY6mpq%2Bhlah8c3yRbGZpa19ngnCCk2qdbHFmm7CigJZtaJ2dZmyFo4CUcp1noKSiuQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jalen-hurts.html><span>←</span><span>Jalen Hurts Age, Net Worth, Girlfriend, Family and Biography (Updated 2023)</span></a>
