In a series first, the two men eliminated during last week’s double eviction — <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Cameron Hardin</a> and Jared Fields — had the opportunity to revive their games while living with those who voted them out.</p><p data-characters=213 data-current-count=554 data-injectable=true>And after four competitions played out, Cameron emerged victorious during the live episode. He’s now back as a full-fledged houseguest while Jared was sent out the front door again. And this time, for good.</p><p data-characters=343 data-current-count=343 data-injectable=false>Cameron and Jared first competed in the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Resurrection Rumble</a> – three competitions that granted the players points. Knowing the winner would receive a major advantage for their showdown later in the week, the two battled as well as they could. But, after the dust settled and the third challenge concluded, Cameron had more points than Jared.</p><p data-characters=41 data-current-count=384 data-injectable=false>The victory then landed Cameron a choice.</p><p data-characters=339 data-current-count=723 data-injectable=true>The battle-back competition was a solo game, meaning one man would play it and the other would stand on the sidelines. Cameron’s triumph in the Resurrection Rumble gave him the power to choose who filled what role. Cameron ultimately decided to throw himself into the fire and put the fate of his Big Brother life in own his hands.</p><p data-characters=229 data-current-count=229 data-injectable=false>The final challenge involved Cameron maneuvering a ball around a large zombie, and after a failed attempt when the ball fell, the 34-year-old stay-at-home dad from Eastman, GA dropped it into the hole and secured his redemption.</p><h2 id=h-players-and-fans-were-already-writing-jared-s-obituary-before-thursday-night data-injectable=false>Players and fans were already writing Jared’s obituary before Thursday night</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=529 data-injectable=true>https://youtu.be/s2TCO0oUgxo?si=92S98zec45qEUucU</figure><p data-characters=273 data-current-count=273 data-injectable=false>Before Thursday’s episode, many houseguests and fans were already looking past zombie week and toward the game restarting. And they viewed Cameron as the most likely winner while almost disregarding Jared’s chances of returning. Well, they weren’t wrong.</p><p data-characters=74 data-current-count=347 data-injectable=false>Cameron has proven himself to be a major competition threat in the house.</p><p data-characters=253 data-current-count=600 data-injectable=true>Up to that point, Cameron had earned Head of Household twice while notching one Power of Veto win. With Cameron locking himself in as Thursday night’s player, his chances of toppling whatever Big Brother competition was in front of him were high.</p><p data-characters=463 data-current-count=463 data-injectable=true>Another layer to Cameron’s Big Brother storyline is how he received a new lease on life weeks after his first Head of Household run was nullified. When Cameron ran the house in week 4, he targeted Jagateshwar “Jag” Bains. Sitting next to Blue Kim, Jag was eventually evicted by a unanimous vote. But, Matt Klotz had secretly won the power to save a houseguest, and he used it on Jag, thus rendering Cameron’s Head of Household reign void.</p><p data-characters=245 data-current-count=245 data-injectable=false>So, how will Cameron do in the house, and is he still public enemy No. 1? Well, he forged an alliance with Matt and Jag during zombie week while being verbal about wanting Felicia Cannon out next. How will that fare for him? Only time will tell!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y4tM5mrqimXam1pnnZqKSboZVisKmty6Wcp5%2BVYryvecGinmaaoqTBqbHRaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./michael-j-fox-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Michael J Fox Net Worth [2023 Update] : Charity &amp;amp; Cars</span></a>
