His <a href=#>Father</a> Paul was a Jamaican-born car mechanic of European descent who moved to Britain in 1960, and his mother was a legal secretary from East Sussex. After gaining 13 O Levels, he attended the University of Southampton which he graduated from in 1988 with a first-class honours in accounting and <a href=#>Business</a> economics. Whilst at Southampton, a tutor advised him to apply for Harvard <a href=#>Business</a> School, where he completed the Master of <a href=#>Business</a> Administration course. He graduated in 1993 as a Baker Scholar, meaning he was among the top 5 per cent of all graduates.</p><span>1996</span><p>After graduating, Hohn worked for the private equity group Apax Partners. In 1996 he went to work for Perry Capital, a hedge fund on Wall Street. In 1998 he was made head of Perry's London operations. In his time with Perry, he earned an estimated £75m.</p><span>2003</span><p>In 2003, Hohn set up his own hedge fund, The Children's Investment Fund. TCI donated regularly to a connected charitable fund, The Children's Investment Fund Foundation, run by his wife. The original formula involved transfers of 0.5 percent of the fund's assets each year, with a further 0.5 per cent of assets for every year during which the fund achieved returns of more than 11 per cent. It is reported that Hohn established the formulaic charitable link in order to motivate himself. More recently, in March 2013, TCI announced that it would stop donating to the foundation because it is "large enough."</p><span>2013</span><p>In 2013 it was reported that Hohn had begun divorce proceedings with his wife. In November 2014, he was set to pay his American-born ex-wife $500m in what is thought to be the biggest divorce settlement ever awarded by an <a href=#>English</a> court. In December 2014, he was ordered to pay his ex-wife £337M.</p><span>2014</span><p>Hohn was appointed Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George (KCMG) in the 2014 Birthday Honours for services to philanthropy and international development.</p><span>2016</span><p>In 2016, <i>Forbes</i> listed Chris Hohn as one of the 25 Highest-Earning hedge fund managers in 2015. His 2015 total earnings of $250 millions ranks him the 12th among the 25 top earning hedge fund managers.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.idolnetworth.com/images/play_game.png alt="More or less Game" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <a href=# class=btn>Play Game</a><h2>Some Christopher Hohn images</h2><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.idolnetworth.com/images/48/christopher-hohn-0.jpg alt="Christopher Hohn" title="Christopher Hohn" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.idolnetworth.com/images/48/christopher-hohn-1.jpg alt="Christopher Hohn" title="Christopher Hohn" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.idolnetworth.com/images/48/christopher-hohn-2.jpg alt="Christopher Hohn" title="Christopher Hohn" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><h2>Tags:</h2><a href=#>1966 births</a> <a href=#>Alumni of the University of Southampton</a> <a href=#>English hedge fund managers</a> <a href=#>English philanthropists</a> <a href=#>English billionaires</a> <a href=#>Giving Pledgers</a> <a href=#>Harvard Business School alumni</a> <a href=#>Living people</a> <a href=#>People from Addlestone</a> <a href=#>English people of Jamaican descent</a> <a href=#>Knights Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrDOpaWerKekv7W0jZympmeTnb%2Bqv9Oop6GdomK1sLTNZqWerF2svLPAx2ZsaWppbQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./annabeth-gish-plays-it-smart-with-mystic-role.html><span>←</span><span>Annabeth Gish plays it smart with 'Mystic' role | Interviews</span></a>
