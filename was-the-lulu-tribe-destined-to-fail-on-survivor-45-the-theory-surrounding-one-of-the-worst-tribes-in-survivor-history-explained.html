Just looking at this group, it seems hard to believe casting felt Lulu was physically equal to red and blue, then you’ve got Emily who was always going to be aggressive, and Brandon, Hannah, and Sean to be emotional/neurotic. Altogether in my opinion, this tribe never had a chance to make the merge with numbers — what do you all think?”</p><p data-characters=204 data-current-count=204 data-injectable=false>The Reddit user developed a great argument, something that a great deal of Survivor superfans agreed upon. Naturally, they were not happy about this manipulation by the production team (to say the least).</p><p data-characters=438 data-current-count=642 data-injectable=true>“I think most three tribe seasons they just make a tribe purposefully meant to fail. Matsing, Brains, No Collar, Hustlers, Ua, Lulu. And I don’t think this is even a wild conspiracy, it makes sense entertainment-wise to have one tribe stacked against the odds, although like Kaleb and Sabiyah, I’d be so pissed if I ended up on one of these tribes,” @lavachello explained, with numerous viewers sharing similar responses.</p><p data-characters=191 data-current-count=191 data-injectable=false>“Never thought about that before, but I see it now and agree. Production is always doing what is best for keeping the show entertaining with high ratings,” one Reddit user dished.</p><p data-characters=194 data-current-count=385 data-injectable=false>“I knew they were going to fail upon first sight of the tribe. I turned to my husband and said ‘Well, they’re losing.’ It’s was ridiculously obvious,” another shared.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Lulu-Tribe-Survivor-1.png><p data-characters=267 data-current-count=267 data-injectable=false>“Yeah, without castaways picking teams themselves, there’s no reason Lulu should have that lineup. Production did them DIRTY,” @Ill_Tumblr_4_Ya shared referencing the schoolyard pick that older Survivor seasons utilized and garnering nearly 200 upvotes.</p><p data-characters=251 data-current-count=518 data-injectable=true>Even though the schoolyard pick sparked some controversy due to the fact that it sent the last people picked or those not picked packing, it does not sound like that bad of an idea, given how poorly the Lulu tribe was developed by the production team.</p><p data-characters=477 data-current-count=477 data-injectable=true>“I’m all for schoolyard pick coming back, but not if the last people picked/those not picked are immediate boots. I just re-watched Survivor: Palau and it’s so dang painful to see Wanda go,” @OkSpot8931 added, sharing their suggestions on how Survivor can bring back the schoolyard pick in the future, all in a much more fair way — with no unjust eliminations, it sounds like reviving the schoolyard pick could be a great idea for forthcoming seasons!</p><p data-characters=115 data-current-count=115 data-injectable=false>Will Survivor 45 experience a tribe swap soon?
