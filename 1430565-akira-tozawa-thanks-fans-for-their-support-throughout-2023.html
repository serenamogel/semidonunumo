This year, Tozawa joined forces with <a href=#>Chad Gable</a>, Otis, and Maxine Duprii as part of the Alpha Academy.</p><p><a href=#>The Japanese wrestler</a> had a lot of television time. Akira Tozawa had wrestled top stars such as Shinsuke Nakamura, Bronson Reed, The Miz, and many more. He also is the only male wrestler to have a one-on-one match against the WWE Women’s World Champion Rhea Ripley.</p><p>Tozawa also had an opportunity to win the NXT UK Heritage Cup against Noam Dar. Unfortunately, he was unsuccessful in the attempt to do so. His biggest win of the year came on an episode of Monday Night Raw when he defeated two-time Grandslam Champion, The Miz.</p><p>Akira Tozawa recently took to Twitter to reflect on the past year and thanked the fans for their constant support.</p><p>“My 2023 is over.. I had a hard time but this year was great. Thank you for all your support! I’m so grateful. Merry Christmas! Happy holidays❤️ Be safe ?? ARIGATOOOO! #WWERaw,” Akira Tozawa tweeted.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><h2 id=h-titus-o-neil-is-interested-in-bringing-akira-tozawa-back-to-titus-worldwide>Titus O’Neil is interested in bringing Akira Tozawa back to Titus Worldwide</h2><p>During an interview with Fightful.com, Titus O’Neil <a href=#>opened up</a> about potentially recruiting Akira Tozawa back into the Titus Worldwide faction.</p><p>“Chad Gable has his own thing with Alpha Academy, but I would definitely bring Tozawa back. That dude is so entertaining, ridiculously entertaining. If I had to get a female superstar, I’d like to get Jade [Jade Cargill] as part of Titus Worldwide. Another male, probably Carmelo Hayes. I really really like him. I think he’s going to be a big star in our business. Great personality. I’d probably throw Trick Williams in there too just because, even though he went to South Carolina, and Gators and South Carolina…I can prove on national TV that Gators and Gamecocks can work together in a non-competitive way and put out a good product,”&nbsp;Titus O’Neil.
