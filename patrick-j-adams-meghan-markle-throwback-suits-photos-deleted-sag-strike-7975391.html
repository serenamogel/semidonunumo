Adams just destroyed some evidence. On Wednesday, the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Suits</a> star (he played troubled brainiac Mike Ross) shared a slew of photos from the set of the hit series (which is currently <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>having a resurgence</a> thanks to Netflix), including never-before-seen throwback pictures of his co-star <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>Meghan Markle</a> (who played paralegal-turned-attorney Rachel Zane). Shortly thereafter, every post was scrubbed from his page. In other words, unless you have Mike's photographic memory, the behind-the-scenes images are gone.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Later in the day, the actor explained his decision to delete the photos in a statement posted to his Instagram Story. And it has nothing to do with Meghan and everything to do with the ongoing SAG-AFTRA strike.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"The last couple of days I foolishly and thoughtlessly let a trip down&nbsp;Suits&nbsp;memory lane distract me from the very real and ongoing fight everyone in @sagaftra continues to wage in its effort to win our membership realistic 21st century compensation and protections,”&nbsp;he wrote. “It was an embarrassing oversight for which I'm incredibly sorry."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">He continued, "So grateful to those who gently and swiftly course-corrected me here and I look forward to continuing the fight in the days and weeks ahead. #sagaftrastrong”<br></p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The strike has prohibited actors and SAG members from promoting projects (past or present) in any capacity, including social media posts, according to the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>union's website</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The show first aired back in 2011 on USA and ran for eight seasons before its series finale in 2019. After being picked up by <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Netflix in June</a>, Nielsen&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>reported</a> that the show broke streaming records, and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3>Entertainment Tonight</a> noted that the show had already racked up 3.14 billion minutes of watch time by August.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Executive producer Gene Klein recently spoke to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>TVLine</a> about the show's new legs, saying he "was surprised."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I'm very proud of the show. I, obviously, had a sense when I found out it was coming to Netflix [that] it would probably get another burst of viewing and that kind of thing, but I did not think this would happen," he said. "The first time the [Nielsen] weekly Top 10 came out and the first three seasons were in there, I thought, 'Well, if everyone just keeps on watching, this is going to go on for a while because they'll keep on moving through the seasons,' and that's exactly what's happening. People are sticking with it. It’s lovely."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As far as a reboot goes, Klein says there's nothing currently in the works (that he knows of) but he "wouldn't be surprised" if he got a "call at some point." When asked of Meghan's return for a revival, Klein admitted that it probably wouldn't be possible.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"It was a complicated dance keeping everybody involved, getting all the actors' deals done and keeping them involved through the end of the show," he explained. "I'd be surprised if we could thread that needle for a reunion, but I'd also be delighted if that happened because [when] you do a show for that long, everybody becomes such good friends."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57z5qrq6GToHqrecCdmKarXaKyqLTAp2SmmaKguaZ506GpqK%2BSlrCsedKuoK2rXaW1sMDOrGSdnZyawaawjKyYoGWjqb%2Bqt8RmbnJvZWiGcg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./prison-break-wants-to-be-your-spring-guilty-pleasure.html><span>←</span><span>Prison Break Wants to Be Your Spring Guilty Pleasure | TV/Streaming</span></a>
