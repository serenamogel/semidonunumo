<span>Jenniffer Sheldon</span></p><h1>The Mermaid movie review &amp;amp; film summary (2016)</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>The plot: Jerkish tycoon Liu Xuan (<a href=#>Deng Chao</a>) has made a ton of money off of&nbsp;sonar technology that incidentally&nbsp;murders&nbsp;all&nbsp;nearby sea-life. This includes an understandably pissed-off community of mer-people, led by spiteful Octopus (<a href=#>Show Luo</a>) and naive&nbsp;mermaid Shan (Lin Yun). Since Liu Xuan has a weakness for the ladies, Shan is tasked with avenging her fellow cryptids by&nbsp;seducing and killing him.<br></p><p>But there's a problem: Shan and Liu Xuan like each other.&nbsp;</p><p>"The Mermaid" has many hallmarks of Chow's working-class-egotist-makes-good style of comedy. Chow may not be playing the (apparently not-so-) exaggerated&nbsp;version of his petulant public person here, as he often does. But Liu Xuan can easily be read as Chow's stand-in: he's rich, but "low-class," in the words of Shan's spiteful, mega-rich rival Ruolan (Zhang Yuqi). Flashy clothes and "Cribs"-style parties, complete with poolside babes and decades-old wine, are the hallmarks of Liu Xuan's nouveau riche&nbsp;lifestyle. So when Shan shows up, wearing smeared make-up and ugly&nbsp;rubber weights to disguise her fins, everybody knows that Liu Xuan will still&nbsp;chase after her. He's a phony, as is made apparent by his paste-on pencil mustache. Tony Stark he ain't.&nbsp;But that's part of his character's wisp-thin appeal: he's instantly recognizable as a fake who nevertheless&nbsp;wants to make good.&nbsp;</p><p>Still, while&nbsp;Chao's appropriately exaggerated&nbsp;performance makes Liu Xuan a likable antihero, Lin's turn as Shan is the film's secret weapon. A skilled supporting cast of&nbsp;comedians, including Shan's fellow sea-people, all&nbsp;earn laughs, but Lin has the&nbsp;unenviable&nbsp;task of making you believe that Shan is as awkward as she seems. You have to buy the notion&nbsp;that Shan's sincere when&nbsp;she flashes&nbsp;Xiu Luan and he insists that he get a better look at her wild charms.<br></p><p>Lin's apparent&nbsp;sincerity works wonders since&nbsp;Chow's sense of humor always tends to be more extreme than you expect. I've seen a fair number of Chow films, but his sexual or violent humor always takes me by surprise, as in a police-sketch routine involving a merman penis and a routine about roast chickens and&nbsp;cunnilingus. Lin thankfully makes you believe that&nbsp;such&nbsp;a naive woman could stumble into a romance with a man she wants to assassinate. Lin's not a victim of Chow's dirty mind: she's an essential&nbsp;collaborator.</p><p>You may be wondering, <i>If this movie is so bizarre, so wonderful, so funny, why haven't I heard of it?</i> The answer to that question is infuriating. Chow's "Shaolin Soccer" and "Kung Fu Hustle" were international hits, and he's a mega-star in&nbsp;his native&nbsp;Hong Kong. Last weekend, "The Mermaid" shattered domestic box office records in China and <a href=#>became the #2 movie in the world</a>, after "<a href=#>Deadpool</a>." Its American release is an afterthought for one reason: mismanagement by its American distributor, <a href=#>Sony Corporation of America</a>. (In theory the film is distributed by Asia Releasing, a subsidiary that handles the release of Asian films in the US and Canada, but the print I saw had a plain old Sony logo in front of it.)&nbsp;<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46tn55lnZq%2Frq3InWRraGFr</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./rece-davis-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography-how-much-money-make-html.html><span>←</span><span>Rece Davis Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</span></a>
