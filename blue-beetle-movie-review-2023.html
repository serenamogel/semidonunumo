<span>Reinaldo Massengill</span></p><h1>Blue Beetle movie review &amp;amp; film summary (2023)</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>While the Blue Beetle character dates back to 1939, the updated, culturally specific incarnation of Jaime Reyes didn’t grace DC pages until 2006. Since then, comic book movies have become the center of American pop culture. But those films have only recently attempted to touch every corner of human existence. Marvel Studios has, for instance, the “<a href=#>Black Panther</a>” series and “<a href=#>Eternals</a>,” Sony has the animated “<a href=#>Spider-Man</a>,” while DCU has “<a href=#>Black Adam</a>,” “<a href=#>Aquaman</a>,” “Birds of Prey,” and, to a lesser extent, the “<a href=#>Justice League</a>” film. While diverse, the DCU movies have mostly avoided locking characters into any sort of cultural specificity. “Blue Beetle” marks a sharp break from that unwritten edict.&nbsp;</p><p>Directed by <a href=#>Ángel Manuel Soto</a> (“<a href=#>Charm City Kings</a>”), this heartwarming, crowd-pleasing comic book flick is less serious and more colorful than the tonally dour mood of many contemporary superhero films.&nbsp;</p><p>A mountain of love falls fast when Jaime (an endearing Xolo Maridueña) arrives home from college to the fictional Palmera City; hugs, jokes, and genuine affection compose these early scenes. But all's not well with the Reyes family: Jaime’s father, Alberto (<a href=#>Damián Alcázar</a>), recently lost his auto shop business. Now, Jaime’s childhood home is in danger of being repossessed by Kord Industry. Despite his pre-law degree, Jaime struggles to land a job. He goes to work with his younger waggish sister Milagro (<a href=#>Belissa Escobedo</a>) as help at a resort.&nbsp;</p><p>Much of “Blue Beetle” concerns the economic disparity between the haves and have-nots, particularly regarding imperialist powers. A person like Jaime can do all the right things: go to college, remain humble, and be pleasant—yet his background, a poor Mexican residing in the disadvantaged Edge Keys neighborhood, will always limit his future. However, he thinks he finds a lifeline when he steps in between the philanthropic Jenny Kord (<a href=#>Bruna Marquezine</a>) and her ruthless aunt Victoria. Though Victoria fires him, Jenny offers him a job if he’ll meet with her the next day at Kord headquarters.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46bo66dXZeypsDLnmSmp6aesm6%2BxK%2Bgnq9dZ31zfw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./miguel-herrera.html><span>←</span><span>Miguel Herrera</span></a>
