John, who'd <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://people.com/archive/papas-odyssey-vol-53-no-13/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="left his first wife" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">left his first wife</a> to marry Michelle, was ready for the couple to sing with tenor Denny Doherty.

She was also <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/john-it-sounded-like-the-mamas-and-the-papas-41140/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="fun to be around" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">fun to be around</a>. However, John felt her being overweight would turn off audiences. According to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/mama-cass-elliot-dead-47050/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Rolling Stone" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Rolling Stone</a>, Elliot was only allowed to sing with the other three after she'd followed them around, including to the Virgin Islands (the four did travel there, but Elliot's sister has suggested this version of the story may have been skewed due to John's jealousy that Elliot became the breakout star of the group).</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">According to Elliot, her trip to the islands was significant in another way: It left her with an expanded vocal range for the beautiful harmonies John composed. "I did get hit on the head by a pipe that fell down and my range was increased by three notes." Elliot told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/the-rolling-stone-interview-cass-elliot-75434/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Rolling Stone" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Rolling Stone</a> in 1968. "I had a bad headache for about two weeks and all of a sudden I was singing higher. It’s true."

Elliot was in love with Doherty, who wasn't interested in her as a romantic partner. Michelle was a believer in free love, so marriage to John didn't keep her from an affair with Doherty (among others).</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 2007, Michelle recalled the sexual tensions in the group to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2007/12/phillips200712 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Vanity Fair" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Vanity Fair</a>, saying, "The four of us would sit around, saying, 'O.K., you're gonna sing the third,' and 'You're gonna do the bop da bops,' and there'd be so much sexual energy between Denny and me that we’d be playing footsie under the table, and Cass and John didn’t notice it." But the liaison eventually came to light. Michelle <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://people.com/music/rock-love-triangles/?slide=5804751#5804751" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="later shared" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">later shared</a> one painful ramification: "Cass confronted me and said, 'I don't get it. You could have any man you want. Why would you take mine?'"</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">John objected to his wife being with his tenor, though at his behest he and Doherty transformed the experience into the co-written "I Saw Her Again" (Doherty sang lead; it was another hit). However, according to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://people.com/music/rock-love-triangles/?slide=5804751#5804751" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=People class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">People</a>, after learning his wife was involved with Gene Clark of the Byrds, John kicked Michelle out of the group and brought in a new "Mama" in the midst of recording the group's second album, The Mamas & the Papas (1966). According to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2007/12/phillips200712 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Vanity Fair" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Vanity Fair</a>, Michelle fought for her place and eventually returned, thanks in part to fan support. It's unknown which parts of the second album have Michelle singing and which have her temporary replacement's voice.</p><h2 data-node-id=14 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Elliot found success as a solo artist</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Even as the Mamas & the Papas ruled the charts, Elliot continued to have little luck in love. "It's easy to find boyfriends," she <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://ew.com/article/1992/07/31/mama-cass-myth-larger-life/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="once said" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">once said</a>. "I buy them a motorcycle, a leather suit, and put them in acting school." She was married, but it was an arrangement intended to help a friend avoid the draft. In 1967, she gave birth to daughter Owen Elliot-Kugell, but Elliot never publicly named the father.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Elliot may not have found true love, but she had a wide social circle. In 1968, <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/the-rolling-stone-interview-cass-elliot-75434/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Rolling Stone" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Rolling Stone</a> described her as "the unchallenged queen of the pop music scene" and her memorable parties were a "Who's Who" of musical talent. She wanted friends David Crosby, Stephen Stills and Graham Nash to sing together, thus helping Crosby, Stills & Nash take shape. "Music happens in my house and that pleases me," she told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/the-rolling-stone-interview-cass-elliot-75434/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Rolling Stone" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Rolling Stone</a>.

The Mamas & the Papas performed there, but their time together was coming to an end. Though Michelle and John got back together long enough to have daughter Chynna (born in 1968), their relationship was still marked by infidelity and other problems (they would divorce in 1970).

I wanted to be able to do television, and a movie it came up, to sort of diversify myself, to extend myself. Within the framework of a group, that freedom is not possible." She proved her capabilities that year with solo hit "Dream a Little Dream of Me." Her feelings for Doherty remained unrequited and he wasn't interested when she proposed marriage.
