After his breakout role in 1979’s Breaking Away, he never looked back, starring in a wide variety of films ranging from huge hits (1983’s The Right Stuff) to disappointments (1983’s Jaws 3-D). Quaid found renewed success in the 1990s with such films as Any Given Sunday, Frequency and Far from Heaven, for which he was named Best Supporting Actor by the New York Film Critics Circle.</p><h2 data-node-id=3 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Early Years</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Dennis William Quaid was born on April 9, 1954, in Houston, Texas. After following in the footsteps of his older brother Randy Quaid (also an accomplished actor) to the University of Houston, Quaid dropped out in 1974, and moved to Los Angeles to pursue an acting career.</p><h2 data-node-id=6 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Movies</h2><h2 data-node-id=7 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">'Breaking Away' and 'The Right Stuff'</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Quaid landed a bit role in Jonathan Demme's Crazy Mama (1975) but made his first substantial big-screen appearance in the 1978 film September 30, 1955. Quaid's breakthrough role came in the acclaimed film Breaking Away (1979), which won an Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Quaid then appeared in the 1980 Western The Long Riders, with his brother Randy, and in the romantic comedy All Night Long (1981), costarring <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/gene-hackman data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Gene Hackman" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Gene Hackman</a> and <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/musicians/barbra-streisand data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Barbra Streisand" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Barbra Streisand</a>. After starring in a few low-rated films like The Night the Lights Went Out in Georgia (1981) and Jaws 3-D (1983), he won acclaim for his portrayal of the cocky astronaut Gordon Cooper in The Right Stuff, the 1983 film version of Tom Wolfe's best-selling book, costarring Sam Shepard and Ed Harris.</p><h2 data-node-id=12 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">'The Big Easy' and 'Innerspace'</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 1987, Quaid's career heated up with his romantic turn as a New Orleans homicide detective who becomes involved with a district attorney (played by Ellen Barkin) in The Big Easy. That same year, he starred opposite <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/musicians/cher data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Cher class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Cher</a> in the thriller Suspect. On the set of the screwball comedy Innerspace (1987), Quaid met actress <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/meg-ryan data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Meg Ryan" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Meg Ryan</a>; the two fell in love while filming their next movie, the thriller D.O.A. (1988), and became engaged in 1989. (Quaid was previously married to another actress, P.J. Soles, from 1978 to 1983.)</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">However, before Ryan would marry him, she forced him to come to terms with his struggles with alcohol and cocaine. After his high-profile film Great Balls of Fire! (1989), in which he played the temperamental rock great <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/musicians/jerry-lee-lewis data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Jerry Lee Lewis" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Jerry Lee Lewis</a>, tanked with both critics and audiences, Quaid resolved to kick his addictions. In 1990, he quit drinking and drugs for good, and he and Ryan were married a year later.</p><h2 data-node-id=15 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">'Postcards from the Edge,' 'Flesh and Bone,' 'Wyatt Earp'</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">After a supporting turn opposite <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/meryl-streep data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Meryl Streep" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Meryl Streep</a> and <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/shirley-maclaine data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Shirley MacLaine" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Shirley MacLaine</a> in Postcards from the Edge (1990), Quaid took a self-imposed hiatus from filmmaking, returning in 1993 with a starring role alongside Ryan in Flesh and Bone, also featuring James Caan and <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/gwyneth-paltrow data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Gwyneth Paltrow" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Gwyneth Paltrow</a>.

His next several films were less successful, including the disappointing big-budget fantasy Dragonheart (1996), Gang Related (1997), Switchback (1997), and Savior (1998). In 1998, he starred in an update of the family classic The Parent Trap and joined an ensemble cast, including <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/sean-connery data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Sean Connery" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Sean Connery</a> and <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/angelina-jolie data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Angelina Jolie" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Angelina Jolie</a> in Playing By Heart.

In 2002, he starred in the baseball fan-favorite The Rookie, and that year he was also named Best Supporting Actor by the New York Film Critics Circle for his role in Todd Haynes' Oscar contender, Far From Heaven.</p><h2 data-node-id=24 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">'The Day After Tomorrow,' 'Vantage Point,' 'Truth'</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The actor continued to headline films like The Alamo (2004), The Day After Tomorrow (2004) and Vantage Point (2008). He made the move to the small screen in 2012 with Vegas, as a 1960s sheriff looking to maintain the law amid the shady doings of the mob, though the show met its end after one season. He went on to appear in the widely panned comedy Movie 43 (2013) and the political drama Truth (2015).</p><h2 data-node-id=26 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">'A Dog's Purpose,' 'Midway'</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Quaid next surfaced in the family film A Dog's Purpose (2017), which spawned the sequel A Dog's Journey two years later. After confirming he would star in a biopic of President <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/political-figures/ronald-reagan data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Ronald Reagan" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Ronald Reagan</a>, Quaid appeared with <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/james-franco data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="James Franco" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">James Franco</a> in the 2018 films Kin and The Pretenders. Then, following a turn as a crazed stalker in The Intruder (2019), Quaid was set to return to a heroic role later that year as Vice Admiral William "Bull" Halsey in the World War II epic Midway.</p><h2 data-node-id=28 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Marriages & Children</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=29 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Throughout the 1990s, Quaid and Ryan were looked to as one of the more stable couples in Hollywood. With their son, Jack, the couple divided their time between homes in New York City, Santa Monica and Paradise Valley, Montana. In June 2000, Quaid and Ryan shocked many by announcing their separation after nine years of marriage. At the same time, Ryan was linked romantically in the press to the Australian actor <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/russell-crowe data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Russell Crowe" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Russell Crowe</a>, her Proof of Life costar.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=31 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Citing "irreconcilable differences" (and claiming there was no third party involved), Quaid filed for divorce in July 2000. He married 32-year-old Texas real-estate agent Kimberly Buffington in July 2004. The couple had twins Thomas Boone and Zoe Grace on November 8, 2007, and endured a scary moment when the babies were mistakenly given an adult dosage of heparin at the hospital. Quaid sued for negligence and filed a lawsuit against the drug manufacturer.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=32 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">After years of separating and reconciling, Quaid and Buffington finalized their divorce in the spring of 2018. Not long afterward, the actor waxed poetic about his years with Ryan to <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/movies-tv/megyn-kelly data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Megyn Kelly" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Megyn Kelly</a>, admitting that his jealousy over her success contributed to their breakup.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=33 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In October 2019, Quaid announced his engagement to girlfriend Laura Savoie, a 26-year-old PhD student at the University of Texas' McCombs School of Business.
