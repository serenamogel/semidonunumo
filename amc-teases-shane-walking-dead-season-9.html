The actor’s set to swing by&nbsp;The Walking Dead&nbsp;for Lincoln’s final hurrah and now, we have our first look at him.</p><p data-characters=250 data-current-count=612 data-injectable=true>Seen in the promo above – or the screenshot below – is a quick glimpse of Shane, as he sits beside Rick in a car.

And it <a href=# rel=noopener>all goes down on Sunday, November 4th, when episode 9×05 “What Comes After”</a> airs and fans everywhere bid farewell to Andrew Lincoln after nearly a decade of watching him in the role.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3yiucJmq56Zo5rAbr%2FHmqWeZaeWuay1zaBknZ2RmXq0scCspqdlaWQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kaaris-net-worth-201330.html><span>←</span><span>Kaaris Net Worth</span></a>
