Charges included first-degree murder, aggravated child abuse, aggravated manslaughter, and four counts of providing false information to law enforcement. Caylee's remains were found buried in plastic bags and she had duct tape on her face. However, it's unknown what exactly happened to Caylee; her autopsy states that she died "by undetermined means" (via <a href=#>In Touch Weekly)</a>. Anthony's defense claimed that Caylee had drowned in the family pool. The prosecution, on the other hand, argued that Anthony had suffocated her daughter using duct tape and chloroform.&nbsp;</p><p>The evidence against Anthony was overwhelming, to say the least.&nbsp;<a href=#>Time</a> reported that traces of chloroform were found in Anthony's car. She had Googled "neck breaking" and "how to make chloroform." If found guilty, she was facing a possible death sentence. <a href=#>ABC News</a> reports that Anthony's lawyer, <a href=#>Jose Baez</a> painted the real culprit as Anthony's father, George Anthony (seen above). Baez claimed that he had found Caylee's dead body in the pool and had disposed of her remains. Anthony then denied knowing what happened to her daughter because she was afraid of George, who had been sexually abusing her for years. George denied these claims.</p><p>Anthony's trial lasted six weeks. In their closing arguments, the prosecution stated that Anthony had murdered her toddler to live a life free of responsibilities (via&nbsp;<a href=#>CBS News</a>). Her legal team argued that the prosecution had not been able to explain how Caylee died, so there was reasonable doubt that Anthony killed her daughter. On July 5, 2011, Casey Anthony was acquitted of first-degree murder (per <a href=#>People</a>).</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunCDknBoaWpfqbWmedGemKVlopqutLvNZpqaq5WueqK606Gmp7FdrK60ecCcqK6hpKmypXnOn2SmraKZsrN7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./sage-robbins.html><span>←</span><span>Sage Robbins Biography</span></a>
