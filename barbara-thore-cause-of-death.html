Barbara Thore was born on June 22, 1946, and died on December 7, 2022, at the age of 76.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Barbara Thore Cause of Death</h2><p>Barbara Thore’s death was announced by her daughter Whitney, according to her, Barbara died as a result of a condition that she has been battling for quite some time. Whitney disclosed this in a lengthy post shared on Instagram. She wrote;</p><p><a href=#><strong>READ ALSO: Barbara Thore Children: Meet Whitney Thore And Hunter Thore</strong></a></p><p><strong>Rest In Peace, Sweet Mommy. June 22, 1946—December 7, 2022</strong></p><p><strong>My mother died last night just as the credits rolled on her favorite movie. Dad, Hunter, and I held her as she took her last breaths. It was 10:32 pm, the same exact time she brought me into this world almost forty years ago.</strong></p><p><strong>My mom had cerebral amyloid angiopathy, which is an untreatable progressive condition caused by proteins in the blood vessels of the brain that can cause dementia, seizures, or like in my mom’s case, brain bleeding (hemorrhagic strokes). When mom had her first stroke in 2017, we were told of this and we knew that more strokes would eventually be inevitable. Mom’s second stroke was on December 28, 2021, and her last was on November 13, 2022.</strong></p><p><strong>My mother is our family’s greatest gift. We could never love, revere, or value another person more. If you’re reading this, you’re familiar with her magic: her southern charm, her hilarious sense of humor, her well-timed witty remarks, her beauty, and her ability to make everyone around her feel comfortable and cared for. But what you can’t possibly understand is the extent of my mother’s love — wh at you may have witnessed and felt through a TV screen is a minute fraction that, even if multiplied by a million, wouldn’t come close to “real life.” That’s how enormous, how generous, and how all-encompassing my mother’s love was. I am the luckiest person on the planet to have been hers for almost 39 years.</strong></p><p><strong>We want to thank you for loving our mother. She delighted in her newfound television career more than we can describe! It gave her such a sense of purpose and excitement and something to look forward to every time the crew came around. This last year navigating life after her second stroke was, perhaps surprisingly, the best of our lives. We never had more fun or laughed as much as we did the past year. The support from all of you made her feel so loved and encouraged. We are unbelievably thankful that we’ve been able to share her with you and it is our hope that her memory will continue to be a source of comfort and happiness for the rest of your lives, just as it will be for ours.</strong></p><p><strong>I love you, Mommy.</strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Barbara Thore Age</h2><p>Barbara Thore was born on June 22, 1946.
