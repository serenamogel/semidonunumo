In the post, we see Meghan holding her little boy as they smile at the camera. Meghan wore a black dress with crystals in the shape of squares shimmering throughout.</p><p class=dh>Her son Riley Sabara wore a pair of green glasses, a few shades brighter than his green shorts. He wore a pair of powder blue clogs and a dark blue T-shirt.</p><p class=dh>In the caption, Meghan revealed that her son said "cheese," presumably when the pictures were captured. <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/CpekGmMrNbJ/>We see Riley</a> in his mother's arms in the first five of the seven photos.

She also showed that she experienced pregnancy symptoms much faster in her second pregnancy than in her first.</p><p class=dh>Meghan is poised to release her debut book titled "Dear Future Mama," said to be in stock from April 25. Meghan told PEOPLE that she will go into the details of her pregnancies to make people feel like they are not alone in "grossness."
