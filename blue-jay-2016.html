<span>Martina Birk</span></p><h1>Blue Jay movie review &amp;amp; film summary (2016)</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>Jim (<a href=#>Mark Duplass</a>) has come home to take care of his mother’s house after her passing. He’s also clearly got some other issues going on, and Duplass is excellent at subtly capturing a man who often appears on the verge of tears. When his high school sweetheart Amanda (<a href=#>Sarah Paulson</a>), home because her sister is about to have a baby, runs into Jim at the grocery store, she too senses an undercurrent of sadness. Perhaps that’s why she agrees to get some coffee with him and then go back to his house to drink, play, laugh and talk about their lives. He needs a friend, and they used to be much more than friends. In his childhood home, they find old love letters and tapes they made together. In one recording, they play-act their 20th wedding anniversary. Being able to listen to a teenage version of yourself pretending to be the age you are now sounds absolutely terrifying to me.</p><p>After listening to that tape, the somewhat-tense dynamic between Jim and Amanda softens. They decide to play-act again, pretending to be a married couple celebrating over dinner. They dance to Annie Lennox. They talk about their lives and their issues. In a sense, they are still those sweetly romantic kids, but jobs and families and other trappings of adulthood just got in the way. They act goofy, almost too much so, but the actors make it feel believable that they’re really acting like teenagers again.</p><p>There’s so much fine detail in the acting work, especially by Paulson, who was so drastically different in her Emmy-winning role on “The People v. OJ Simpson” that everyone who saw that should watch this just to see her remarkable range. Her take on Amanda contains so many subtle layers. There’s a scene early in their time at Jim’s home in which she just laughs and moves her body ever so slightly into his, conveying a comfort through body language, an underutilized tool of the modern actor. “Blue Jay” is a dialogue-driven piece, of course, but it works because of what’s unsaid verbally and what we get from a look by Duplass or a laugh from Paulson. They are both fantastic here, especially her. It’s one of my favorite actress performances of the year.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46bo66dXZ%2BuunmRaWhv</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-happens-if-you-eat-a-lot-of-yogurt.html><span>←</span><span>What happens if you eat a lot of yogurt?</span></a>
