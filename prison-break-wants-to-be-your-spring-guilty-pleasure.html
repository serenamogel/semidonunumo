This is an hour of familiar faces, pulsing music, fast cuts, ridiculous twists, and bad dialogue. At its best, “Prison Break” is kind of the “Fast & Furious” of episodic television—not taking itself too seriously and providing equal amounts of crazy plot twists, action sequences and cheesy dialogue. Only on “Prison Break” could a character say “This piece of gum is going to start a sequence of events that will finish on the other side of the world,” and fans nod along with agreement. Sure, why not? “Prison Break” embraces its ridiculousness, allowing you to check out mentally after a long work day. If that doesn’t sound appealing to you, if you want to break down a show more intellectually, there are plenty of other options.</p><p>After a quick recap (that pretty much ignores seasons two through four), “Prison Break” wastes no time getting into the action. Michael Scofield (<a href=#>Wentworth Miller</a>), thought dead at the end of the series, actually faked his death. T-Bag (<a href=#>Robert Knepper</a>), of all people, gets a photo of Scofield handed to him on his last day of residency at Fox River Penitentiary. He shows the photo to Michael’s brother Lincoln Burrows (<a href=#>Dominic Purcell</a>), who goes to Michael’s widow Sara (<a href=#>Sarah Wayne</a> Callies), since remarried and taking care of her son. Is Michael really alive? Why would he fake his death? And why does the photo make it looks like he’s in another prison? Heading to the other side of the world, “Prison Break” even finds a way to bring Sucre (<a href=#>Amaury Nolasco</a>), C-Note (Rockmund Dunbar) and Agent Kellerman (<a href=#>Paul Adelstein</a>) back into the narrative. The boys are back in town, and ready to break out again.</p><p>The season premiere of “Prison Break” is wonderfully ridiculous, involving remotely controlled cars, digging up a coffin, and a prosthetic hand. It’s knowingly, winkingly cheesy, saying to viewers, <i>Can you believe we’re doing this again?</i> Sadly, when the show settles into the new break plotline in Yemen in subsequent episodes, it’s notably less interesting. “Prison Break” is not exactly the best place to go for any sort of serious analysis of anti-radicalization or the rise of ISIL. And the new break doesn’t live up to the glorious insanity of the first one. It’s actually kind of boring, and the last thing anyone wants from “Prison Break” is boredom.</p><p>However, when the show does embrace its true nature as B-TV escapism—when T-Bag has a robot hand and Lincoln is escaping terrorists—it works better than most of the recent revivals (I’m looking at you, “24: Legacy”). There’s enough real drama in the world in 2017. Sometimes you just want to watch people who are having a <i>much</i> worse day than you are overcome their own problems. Welcome back, Michael Scofield. The world needs you.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmrKyimq6utc2gZqmqmai8r3nBq5yao12srq%2FA0marqGWSmnq6u9SrZKyoop67qHnGrqClrKliva2xwKysq50%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./lucy-hale-loci-sneakers-collection-8387376.html><span>←</span><span>Lucy Hale Told Me She's Walked All of NYC in Comfy Loci Sneakers</span></a>
