He sold Ithaca Holdings, the parent company of SB Projects, to HYBE in 2021 for more than $1 billion. “He’s getting out of management—he has been for years. That’s the real story,” one source told Variety. However, another source suggested unpleasant revelations about Braun might soon emerge, simply saying, “He’s imploding.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=30 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Whatever is happening, Braun will undoubtedly continue to be one of the most polarizing faces in the music industry.</p><span class="css-1s9owpq e17dn9hs1"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/8ebb24a5-6121-4849-a984-bf608cacdd3c_1677508089.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Tyler Piccotti" title="Headshot of Tyler Piccotti" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Tyler Piccotti first joined the Biography.com staff as an Associate News Editor in February 2023, and before that worked almost eight years as a newspaper reporter and copy editor.
