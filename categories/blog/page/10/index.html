Many people nowadays think of Burt Reynolds as a veteran actor who earned an Academy Award nomination for Boogie Nights, but this is only half of the story. It can quite easily be argued that Burt Reynolds was the biggest movie star of the 1970s. He had major hits with Deliverance and Smokey and the Bandit and was also offered the part of Han Solo in Star Wars.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Wildflower movie review &amp;amp; film summary (2023)</h2><time>Sep 7, 2024</time>

For starters, Bea (short for Bambi, her mom’s favorite character) is lying in a hospital bed in a coma, narrating the film in sardonic tones: “I’ve always felt trapped in this family, but this is a whole other level,” she jokes off the top as frantic relatives surround her, fretting about her fate. That can be amusing, especially when she contradicts other characters in a clipped, dry way reminiscent of Ron Howard’s voiceover work on “Arrested Development.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>A coming-of-age thriller that slipped under the radar hits big on streaming</h2><time>Sep 6, 2024</time>

The pandemic has been both a blessing and a curse for lower budget movies, in that many titles to have been pulled from theaters ended up finding a huge audience on-demand instead of potentially sinking without a trace at the box office, while others completely passed everyone by.
Recommended Videos Rebecca Eskreis’ feature-length directorial debut What Breaks the Ice definitely falls into the latter camp, despite the obvious marketing potential possessed by a coming-of-age thriller headlined by Ozark‘s Sofia Hublitz and Outer Banks‘ Madelyn Cline, both of whom have cultivated plenty of fans after playing major roles in a pair of Netflix smash hits.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Forrie J Smith Wikipedia And Age: How Old Is The Actor Who Plays Llyod In Yellowstone?</h2><time>Sep 6, 2024</time>

Toshiba's Qosmio Goes on a Diet
The first thing I noticed about the refreshed Toshiba Qosmio is that it's not insanely enormous like its predecessors were. The Qosmio X775 has shed a lot of weight from the last generation and lost an inch off of the screen. The result: it's nearly four pounds lighter! Most of the extreme gloss is gone, replaced by textured glossy surfaces that at least don't pick up fingerprints, and a sort of "</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Cave Story 3D Gets 2D Sprite Mode Screens</h2><time>Sep 5, 2024</time>
