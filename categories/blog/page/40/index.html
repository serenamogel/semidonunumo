[Intro: Northside Shawty]
Once you‚Äôve found the right doctor
And have told him or her about your pain
Don‚Äôt, don‚Äôt be afraid to take what they give you
Often, it will be an opioid medication
Some patients may be afraid of taking opioids
Because they‚Äôre percieved as too strong or addictive
But that is far from actual fact
Less than one percent of patients taking opioids
Actually become addicted

I don't know if it was there biggest mistake but it was a huge one. The Great Muta was a huge talent and should have been used better. But before i explain...To all those saying Muta was just here on loan from NJPW or that he was a bigger star there so was always going back are just incorrect. Muta actually came over to the US at the tail end of 1985 and stayed until 1990, only going back to Japan for awhile in 87.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Blog</h2><time>May 24, 2024</time>
