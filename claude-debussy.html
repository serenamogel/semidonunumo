Who Was Claude Debussy?Claude Debussy was born into a poor family in France in 1862, but his obvious gift at the piano sent him to the Paris Conservatory at age 11. At age 22, he won the Prix de Rome, which financed two years of further musical study in the Italian capital.

At age 22, he won the Prix de Rome, which financed two years of further musical study in the Italian capital. After the turn of the century, Debussy established himself as the leading figure of French music. During World War I, while Paris was being bombed by the German air force, he succumbed to colon cancer at the age of 55.</p><h2 data-node-id=3 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Early Life</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Achille-Claude Debussy was born on August 22, 1862, in Saint-Germain-en-Laye, France, the oldest of five children. While his family had little money, Debussy showed an early affinity for the piano, and he began taking lessons at the age of 7. By age 10 or 11, he had entered the Paris Conservatory, where his instructors and fellow students recognized his talent but often found his attempts at musical innovation strange.</p><h2 data-node-id=6 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Compositions</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 1880, Nadezhda von Meck, who had previously supported Russian composer Peter Ilich Tchaikovsky, hired Debussy to teach piano to her children. With her and her children, Debussy traveled Europe and began accumulating musical and cultural experiences in Russia that he would soon turn toward his compositions, most notably gaining exposure to Russian composers who would greatly influence his work.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 1884, when he was just 22 years old, Debussy entered his cantata L'Enfant prodigue (The Prodigal Child) in the Prix de Rome, a competition for composers. He took home the top prize, which allowed him to study for three years in the Italian capital, though he returned to Paris after two years. While in Rome, he studied the music of German composer Richard Wagner, specifically his opera Tristan und Isolde. Wagner’s influence on Debussy was profound and lasting, but despite this, Debussy generally shied away from the ostentation of Wagner’s opera in his own works.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Debussy returned to Paris in 1887 and attended the Paris World Exposition two years later. There he heard a Javanese gamelan—a musical ensemble composed of a variety of bells, gongs, metallophones and xylophones, sometimes accompanied by vocals—and the subsequent years found Debussy incorporating the elements of the gamelan into his existing style to produce a wholly new kind of sound.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The music written during this period came to represent the composer's early masterpieces—Ariettes oubliées (1888), Prélude à l'après-midi d'un faune (Prelude to the Afternoon of a Faun; completed in 1892 and first performed in 1894) and the String Quartet (1893)—which were clearly delineated from the works of his coming mature period.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Debussy's seminal opera, Pelléas et Mélisande, was completed in 1895 and was a sensation when first performed in 1902, though it deeply divided listeners (audience members and critics either loved it or hated it). The attention gained with Pelléas, paired with the success of Prélude in 1892, earned Debussy extensive recognition. Over the following 10 years, he was the leading figure in French music, writing such lasting works as La Mer (The Sea; 1905) and Ibéria (1908), both for orchestra, and Images (1905) and Children's Corner Suite (1908), both for solo piano.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Around this same time, in 1905, Debussy's Suite bergamasque was published. The suite is comprised of four parts—"Prélude," "Menuet," "Clair de lune" (now regarded as one of the composer's best-known pieces) and "Passepied."</p><h2 data-node-id=15 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Later Years and Death</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Debussy spent his remaining years writing as a critic, composing and performing his own works internationally. He died of colon cancer on March 25, 1918, when he was just 55 years old, in Paris.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Today, Debussy is remembered as a musical legend, whose uniquely structured compositions have served as a base for musicians over the past century, and will undoubtedly continue to inspire musical creation for decades to come.</p><ul data-node-id=21 class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Name: Achille-Claude Debussy</li><li>Birth Year: 1862</li><li>Birth date: August 22, 1862</li><li>Birth City: Saint-Germain-en-Laye</li><li>Birth Country: France</li><li>Gender: Male</li><li>Best Known For: Embracing nontraditional scales and tonal structures, Claude Debussy is one of the most highly regarded composers of the late 19th and early 20th centuries and is seen as the founder of musical impressionism.</li><li>Industries</li><li>Astrological Sign: Leo</li><li>Schools</li><ul class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Paris Conservatory</li></ul><li>Nacionalities</li><li>Death Year: 1918</li><li>Death date: March 25, 1918</li><li>Death City: Paris</li><li>Death Country: France</li></ul><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">We strive for accuracy and fairness.If you see something that doesn't look right,<a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/contact-us data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="contact us" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">contact us</a>!</p><br data-node-id=24><ul data-node-id=26 class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Article Title: Claude Debussy Biography</li><li>Author: Biography.com Editors</li><li>Website Name: The Biography.com website</li><li>Url: https://www.biography.com/musicians/claude-debussy</li><li>Access Date:</li><li>Publisher: A&amp;E; Television Networks</li><li>Last Updated: April 22, 2021</li><li>Original Published Date: April 2, 2014</li></ul><ul data-node-id=29 class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Music is the space between the notes.</li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o7XOoKmaqJiue6S7zGikrquZmLaiutJomqWZpZmybrDEm6ysq6k%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./most-expensive-amiibo.html><span>←</span><span>25 Most Expensive Amiibo figures in the World</span></a>
