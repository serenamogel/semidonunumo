If I could open my arms
And span the length of the isle of Manhattan,
I’d bring it to where you are
Making a lake of the East River and Hudson
If I could open my mouth
Wide enough for a marching band to march out
They would make your name sing
And bend through alleys and bounce off all the buildings.
I wish we could open our eyes
To see in all directions at the same time</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Pat McAfee Almost Broke His Wrist During Brock Lesnar Segment</h2><time>Apr 21, 2024</time>
