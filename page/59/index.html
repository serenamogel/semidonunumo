<a href=../../nvidia-geforce-gtx-560m-highend-mobile-graphics-with-optimus.html></a>
Our collective wishes have been granted by the fine folks at NVIDIA: you can now buy a notebook with high-end graphics that supports Optimus and thus is capable of offering excellent battery life. NVIDIA is refreshing their GeForce GTX 460M into the GTX 560M, bringing higher clock speeds and improved performance.
Actually, we need to thank their notebook partners and Intel as much as NVIDIA, as the reality is that all the 400M series had the potential for supporting Optimus.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>45 Easy Summer Dinner Ideas</h2><time>Mar 21, 2024</time>

<a href=../../donnie-darko-cast-where-are-they-now.html></a>
Since the 2001 release of Donnie Darko, fans have been trying to figure out the meaning behind the mysterious film — and so has the cast.
In the cult classic, a troubled teen named Donnie Darko (played by Jake Gyllenhaal) narrowly survives a freak accident and is left with disturbing visions of a giant rabbit named Frank (James Duval), who tells him the world will end in 28 days.
For many, the psychological thriller, which takes place in the late ‘80s, was their introduction to Gyllenhaal, who had only appeared in five movies before starring in Donnie Darko.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Intel Announces Q3 FY 2018 Earnings: Record Quarter</h2><time>Mar 21, 2024</time>

ROG Strix Scar 17 (2023): Battery&nbsp;Performance While battery life is normally one of the key aspects of a notebook computer, gaming laptops are somewhat of an exception.

There are extreme cases of this, such as desktop replacement laptops, where they are really meant to spend most of their life plugged in. That's the classification for a notebook such as the ASUS ROG Strix Scar 17, which features desktop-optimized parts that naturally operate with higher power levels due to their higher-end specifications.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Cheryl Burke Husband: Is Cheryl Burke Married?</h2><time>Mar 18, 2024</time>
