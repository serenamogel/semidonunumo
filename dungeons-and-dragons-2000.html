<span>Jenniffer Sheldon</span></p><h1>Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons movie review (2000)</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>The plot does not defy description, but it discourages it. Imagine a kingdom that looks half the time like a towering fantasy world of spires and turrets, castles and drawbridges--and the other half like everyone is standing around in the wooded area behind Sam's Club on the interstate. Imagine some characters who seem ripped from the pages of action comics, and other characters who look like their readers. Imagine arch, elevated Medievalese alternating with contemporary slang. The disconnects are so strange that with a little more effort, they could have become a style.</p><p>Empress Savina (<a href=#>Thora Birch</a>) rules in a land where the Mages run everything and the commoners do all the work. She fights for equality, but a scheming Mage named Profion (<a href=#>Jeremy Irons</a>--yes, Jeremy Irons) wants to wrest power from her. This will involve obtaining a magic scepter, which I think (this is a little obscure) is powered by a gem known as the Dragon's Eye. Plugging the eye into the scepter will allow Profion to command the kingdom's dragons, overthrow the empress, and retain power for himself and his fellow Mages.</p><p>Meanwhile (there are a lot of meanwhiles in this film), enter two thieves, Ridley (<a href=#>Justin Whalin</a>) and Snails (<a href=#>Marlon Wayans</a>). Ridley is a cross between action hero and mall rat; Snails tilts more toward Stepin Fetchit ("Be careful!" Ridley is always telling Snails, and then he'll turn and bang his head on a beam). Soon they accumulate three sidekicks: Marina (<a href=#>Zoe McLellan</a>), who knows a lot of magic; Elwood the dwarf (<a href=#>Lee Arenberg</a>), and Norda (<a href=#>Kristen Wilson</a>), whose breastplate is a metallic salute to the guns of Navarone.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46drKeflaS7tHnAp5tmnKKWtLC60mZpaWhg</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./anirban-dasgupta-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-568285-html.html><span>←</span><span>Anirban Dasgupta Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography</span></a>
