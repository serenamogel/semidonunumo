Not the first thing you’d expect from a reality TV star.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=605 data-current-count=605 data-injectable=true>Hassan made millions through multiple high-profile modeling collaborations over the years. With an <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">estimated net worth</a> of $1.5 million, she has gained a huge following in the modeling community over the years. Back in 2012, Hassan also made a foray into the business world, teaming up with non-profit Oxfam to create an umbrella brand called Maji Umbrellas. The entire brand was designed around raising money and awareness towards the clean water crisis in East Africa, giving back to the region she is originally from. However, it would be nearly 10 years before Hassan created her next business venture.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by UBAH HOT (@ubahhot)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=553 data-current-count=853 data-injectable=true>Hassan is no stranger to working in the food business. Before entering the modeling business, she ran <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">her own restaurant</a> in Toronto in her early 20s. But the businesswoman wouldn’t return to the industry until 2021 when she launched her Ubah Hot sauce brand. Inspired by African flavors, the sauce is 100% vegan and designed to be the perfect accent to a healthy lifestyle. Upon its release, the sauce was quickly a best seller and even got a stamp of approval from Oprah, landing on Oprah’s Favorite Things list for the 2021 holiday season.</p><p data-characters=259 data-current-count=259 data-injectable=false>Now that Bravo fans have been <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">introduced to Hassan</a> and her hot sauce brand, people are dying to get their hands on a jar of Ubah Hot. But where exactly can you find Ubah Hot sauce? Sadly, it’s not available in stores, but it’s easy to find online.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=559 data-injectable=true><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by UBAH HOT (@ubahhot)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=356 data-current-count=356 data-injectable=false>You can buy the sauces directly from <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Hassan’s website</a>, as well as learn more about what goes into the sauces she sells. As of writing this, you can only buy the sauces in a 3-pack, but it gives you a chance to try all three flavors. Ranging from mild to hot, Ubah Hot offers Fresno Mild, Serrano Medium, and Habanero Hot to meet all your spice needs.</p><p data-characters=483 data-current-count=839 data-injectable=false>If you have Amazon Prime, you can also get the 3-pack on there with free shipping to boot. However, don’t expect a price drop because you’re on Amazon; it’s still the same price as Hassan’s website. Amazon gives shoppers the added benefit of reviews, and with 69 ratings, Ubah Hot sits at 4.2 out of 5 stars on Amazon. While most of the one-star reviews are just people complaining that the jars broke during transit, take the low rating with a grain of salt.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2S%2FqbvNsmSwoJWnsm6vwKdkomWXmsFuwcGan2agkajAorrSZqybmZhitbDAjKyYrpuVZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./lil-kim.html><span>←</span><span>Lil Kim- Bio, Age, Ethnicity, Boyfriend, Height, Net Worth, Career</span></a>
