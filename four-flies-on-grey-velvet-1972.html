<span>Reinaldo Massengill</span></p><h1>Four Flies on Grey Velvet movie review (1972)</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>Instead, she turns up in badly clubbed and incoherent murder thrillers like this one. She plays the wife of a man who thinks he is guilty of murder. In fact, he's the target of a game player who, like Bobby Fischer, likes to see 'em squirm. Beset by guilt, insomnia and a recurring dream of a public beheading, the poor guy goes a little bananas. Especially after his housekeeper is murdered and he gets a note saying he's next.&nbsp;</p><p>This is the kind of material that a disciplined director could get to hum right along. Instead, <a href=#>Dario Argento</a> uses so many murky shadows, echoing footsteps and anonymous phone calls that we get confused right along with the hero. He also cheats in another way: He throws in absolutely no clues, so that we're just as surprised at the ending as the hero is.&nbsp;</p><p>One of Hitchcock's favorite subjects has been the innocent man, wrongly accused. "Four Flies on Grey Velvet" does have a potentially interesting plot twist: the guilty man, wrongly accused. But nothing much comes of it. And there are a couple of unbelievable characters - a bohemian artist and his scruffy friend - who wander into the plot by accident and clutter things up with distractingly mannered performances.&nbsp;</p><p>There is, however, the interesting Mimsy Farmer, who has the best mouth since <a href=#>Joey Heatherton</a>. There is a rather broad, but gentle, caricature of a homosexual private detective played by <a href=#>Jean Pierre Marielle</a>. There are a few scary moments in the dark. But then there's that image-on-the-retina gimmick, which we can't believe, and a conclusion that's so arbitrary we feel tricked. Also, there is only one fly in this movie.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46fpq6qXZu5qrHSZqanZZensrp51Z6jr52kYn56g5E%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./survivor-keith-nale-obituary-death-cause.html><span>←</span><span>Survivor: Keith Nale Obituary Death Cause Age And Wife</span></a>
