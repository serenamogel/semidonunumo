Kahi Lee then asked Mai if she wanted to "de-spouse" the house, to which she agreed.</p><p class=dh>Mai chose to have design features that would showcase her single status, saying she wanted to go more grown, sexy, and glamorous.</p><p class=dh>Midway through the video, Lee was finished with the design and <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggQv99YIiCk">revealed a new one</a>.
