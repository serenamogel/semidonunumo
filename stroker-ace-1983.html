<span>Larita Shotwell</span></p><h1>Stroker Ace movie review &amp;amp; film summary (1983)</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>Reynolds plays the same basic Good Ol' Boy he's been refining for years -- the sly, woman-chasing character with a couple of good buddies and an eye on the big time. He needs somebody to sponsor his car, and he ends up with Clyde Torkle, a fried-chicken king who is played by <a href=#>Ned Beatty</a> with a low bow in the directions of Col. Sanders and <a href=#>Jackie Gleason</a>. Torkle makes Reynolds paint the slogan Fastest Chicken in the West! on the side of his car. This provides most of the dramatic conflict in the movie.</p><p>Reynolds' sidekick is an auto mechanic named Lugs (<a href=#>Jim Nabors</a>), and the romantic interest is <a href=#>Loni Anderson</a>. She plays a Sunday-school teacher who doesn't drink and is a virgin. So Reynolds slips her some champagne, gets her drunk and, in an unpleasant, unfunny and creepy scene, semi-undresses her while making small talk to her unconscious body.</p><p>Loni Anderson is so innocuous in this movie, they must have given her the wrong script. The movie is stolen in the sex-symbol department by a creature named <a href=#>Cassandra Peterson</a> [aka Elvira], who has a dynamite scene with Jim Nabors. She has long black hair and a ton of eye makeup and looks like a cross between <a href=#>Gina Lollobrigida</a> and Vampirella. She's the best thing in the movie.</p><p>Which brings us to the director. Hal Needham is a onetime stunt coordinator who was a legend in his field. He moved up to directing with encouragement from his old buddy Reynolds, and together they've made five "Smokey"-type movies. There is hardly a spark of inspiration in any of those films, but Reynolds is a box-office champion who can sell anything, even Needham's leadfooted direction. If Reynolds were prepared to work with a good director, he might today be hailed as the superb romantic comedian he is, rather than as the assembly line box-office product he seems determined to become.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46sq6unm5q%2Fbq3CnmRqcWho</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./mindy-kaling-explains-how-into-the-spider-verse-inspired-velma.html><span>←</span><span>Mindy Kaling explains how Into the Spider-Verse inspired Velma</span></a>
