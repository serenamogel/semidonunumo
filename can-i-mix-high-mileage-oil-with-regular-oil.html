High-mileage oils have ingredients to take care of older engines, like conditioners, seal swells, antioxidants, detergents and wear or friction additives. Typically they use a viscosity modifier that is durable and won't lose viscosity very easily.<h2>Can two different engine oils be mixed?</h2>Yes, you can safely mix one brand of oil (e.g. Mobil 1) with a different brand (e.g. AMSOIL) or conventional oil with synthetic oil (in fact, that's what a synthetic blend is). Most synthetics today are fully compatible with conventional oils and can safely be mixed.<h2>Can synthetic oil be mixed with regular oil?</h2>Yes, you can safely mix synthetic and conventional oil. All motor oil, whether synthetic or conventional, is a combination of base oils and additives. Each are designed to be used in the same applications, so they each pass the same minimum standards.<h2>Will Mixing 10 Motor Oils Damage an Engine? Let's find out!</h2><p></p><h2>Can you switch to synthetic oil with high mileage?</h2>You can switch from conventional motor oil to Mobil 1™ synthetic oil (and back again, if you want) without following any special procedures. There are two exceptions to this: a higher-mileage engine that has never used synthetic motor oil, or an engine that has used conventional motor oil and been poorly maintained.<h2>Is high mileage synthetic oil worth it?</h2>It can help reduce oil consumption, smoke, and emissions from older engines. High mileage oil also works to minimize leaks and oil seepage. While you could use high mileage oil in a younger car without harming it, the issues that high mileage oil addresses usually don't appear in vehicles with fewer than 75,000 miles.<h2>Is it OK to top up engine oil with different brand?</h2>You can add any engine oil as long as it has the right specifications — preferably with an official approval of the OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer). Not the brand, but the specification and viscosity indicated in your car's manual are your reference for using the right oil.<h2>Is it OK to mix engine oil viscosities?</h2>yes you can mix same brand and type oils with different viscosity and it will be fine as long as you don't mix them 50/50. If you mix 200 ml of oil with the rest of oil needed for your engine you will be totally fine.<h2>Can you mix oils of the same weight?</h2>You can indeed use the same oil weight already in the vehicle, but mixing weights just isn't recommended.<h2>Is it good to use high mileage oil?</h2>Importantly, high mileage oil helps prevent aging seals and gaskets from becoming brittle and causing leaks, which are usually evidenced by oil stains on the pavement where the car is parked. This can lead to increased oil consumption and even costly engine damage.<h2>Does high mileage oil stop leaks?</h2>High mileage oils contain additives and seal enhancers that reduce leaks (both internal and external). It's possible that after an oil change or two, the leaking could stop. This has the potential to reduce oil spots in your driveway and on burning oil in older engines.<h2>How long does high mileage oil last?</h2>Quick-lube chains say 3,000 miles, auto manufacturers recommend 5,000 to 7,500 miles and synthetic oil companies, 10,000.<h2>What happens if you mix high mileage oil with regular?</h2>High-mileage motor oil.<p>As you can see, each of these oils is scientifically formulated. Mixing them will not improve the performance or efficiency of your engine in any way. Nor will mixing improve the oil performance, either.</p><h2>What happens if you mix engine oil?</h2>Mixing different types can destabilize your motor oil, reducing its efficiency and affecting your engine's performance. The smartest choice is to stick with the oil type and oil change intervals recommended by your car's manufacturer and visit your local car care experts for affordable services.<h2>Can you mix 10W30 and 10W40?</h2>Mixing 10W30 with 10W40<p>Some say that mixing them is fine as long as you don't live in freezing weather. Even if you put together synthetic and conventional blends of these motor oils, they show no harm to your vehicle. However, this is true only if you mix in a quart of the other type to your usual engine oil.</p><h2>Can you mix different weights of synthetic oil?</h2>You can mix 'em just fine. While it's true that Synthetic isn't quite like dino-oil (where the base stock is essentially the same and viscosity deltas are mostly a function of additives). Viscosity is formulated into the synthetic, but there's no problem mixing. You can mix Synthetic and Mineral oils too, if you want.<h2>Will thicker oil damage my engine?</h2>Using oil that is thicker than recommended may lead to a decrease in fuel economy, a higher load on your engine, and even a shorter life for your engine. Conversely, using thinner, lighter-weight oil than recommended can cause excessive wear and shorter life.<h2>Will the wrong oil damage my engine?</h2>Cause damage to engine life<p>The wrong engine oil can cause engine damage because it does not properly lubricate its components. This will lead to metal-on-metal contact since the moving parts are not being lubricated. Friction quickly follows, causing engine parts to wear.</p><h2>Can I use 10w40 instead of 5w30?</h2>Your vehicle does not use 5W-30 oil. The recommended oil viscosity for your vehicle, according to Kia documentation, is 10W-40. If you drive the vehicle in exceptionally cold weather, well below 32 degrees, you can use 5W-30 oil but even 10W-40 is still perfectly OK to use if outdoor temperatures are below freezing.<h2>Should I use full synthetic or high mileage?</h2>As a rule of thumb, most new cars require synthetic oil. Older cars generally run well with conventional oil, unless your vehicle has more than 75,000 miles on it, in which case high-mileage oil is recommended.<h2>What's the best oil for high mileage cars?</h2><p>10 Top-Rated Oils and Additives for High-Mileage Vehicles</p><ul><li>Valvoline High Mileage with MaxLife Technology Synthetic Blend Motor Oil. ...</li><li>Pennzoil High Mileage Motor Oil. ...</li><li>Slick 50 Recharged High Mileage Treatment. ...</li><li>Gumout Fuel System Cleaner. ...</li><li>Royal Purple High Mileage Synthetic. ...</li><li>Techron Fuel Cleaner. ...</li><li>Mobil Super High Mileage Oil.</li></ul><h2>Is it better to use thicker oil in high mileage engine?</h2>A: Yes. This is a practical method to improve oil pressure in an older, high-mileage engine. The slightly thicker oil film from the heavier base weight oil - 10W - can help protect worn engine bearings as well.<h2>When should you not use synthetic oil?</h2>Better For Older Engines<p>This being said, however, it is still not recommended to use synthetic oil in engines that have experienced significant actions – specifically, those that have reached around 75,000 miles on the odometer.</p><h2>Will synthetic oil damage a high mileage engine?</h2>Generally speaking, it's safe to run synthetic oil in an older or high milage engine. That's not what you might read online though. And there's a reason for that. It used to be true that synthetic oil wasn't good for older engines, namely because the additives in synthetic oils can damage the seals and gaskets.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrTnqmvoZWsrrOxwGeaqKVfm66ye8KapWahXaK2uXnHop6hZZ2euaatxp5kqKGcYsSqwMdmqZ6fpaGus3nOoqM%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./can-an-only-son-be-drafted.html><span>←</span><span>Can an only son be drafted?</span></a>
