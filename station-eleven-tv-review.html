<span>Larita Shotwell</span></p><h1>Station Eleven movie review &amp;amp; film summary ()</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>That’s especially true because of the role that theatre plays in the narrative. This is a story of performers, a famous one who influences a younger one, who then decides that art can’t be lost even as civilization crumbles. It’s also a story of acts of kindness, which becomes its most moving theme for me. Jeevan is the first man to stand up when he senses another person is struggling, and that decision changes the lives of so many people, really setting the entire story in motion—nothing here is the same without it. I’m a sucker for stories of one unselfish act starting a butterfly effect through the lives of others, and when I sat back and considered that aspect of “Station Eleven” after the incredibly moving finale, I was so impressed with how this journey had been crafted. It’s the first show since the end of “The Leftovers” that reminds me of that masterpiece, another program about loss and connection, and what I consider one of the best dramas of all time. (It should be noted that Somerville was a writer on "The Leftovers,"&nbsp;so the influence isn't coincidental.)</p><p>Like “The Leftovers,” “Station Eleven” can also be charmingly unpredictable. It has a dark, unexpected sense of humor. It balances almost broadly melodramatic scenes of emotion with more surreal moments of unexpected plot. And it doesn’t have a false performance. Davis somehow finds a way to reflect both the voice of reason that Kirsten&nbsp;became and the little girl who never went home after her friend died in front of her. Patel is similarly subtle in that he could have overplayed a hero role in Jeevan but finds more of a relatable everyman tone that pays off in the final episodes. He's just the guy who meets the moment and doesn’t even realize that so many people don’t. Wilmot is a natural, charismatic performer. Bernal and Deadwyler only have a few scenes compared to the rest, but they make the most of them. <a href=#>Daniel Zovatto</a> plays a mysterious character who calls himself The Prophet, a walking study in how trauma can form a destructive personality. And then small roles are filled out by vibrant character actors like <a href=#>David Cross</a>, <a href=#>Lori Petty</a>, <a href=#>Enrico Colantoni</a>, and <a href=#>Timothy Simons</a>, among others. I loved every performance.</p><p>Again, “Station Eleven” will be too much for some people right now, especially those dealing with the loss of a loved one over the last couple years, but there’s also an incredibly moving undercurrent of hope that pulses through this production. Loss reshapes the world, but it doesn’t stop it from turning.</p><p>First three episodes premiere on HBO Max today. Whole series screened for review.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46sq5qsmaS7brHLnq2epl2pw26%2BxK%2Bgnq8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./national-hug-your-dog-day-5-facts-and-different-ways-to-make-pooches-feel-special.html><span>←</span><span>National Hug Your Dog Day: 5 facts and different ways to make pooches feel special</span></a>
