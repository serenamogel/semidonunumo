Regardless how much we appreciate transparency, it's rarely offered in this industry. Manufacturers love to package all information into nice marketable nuggets and the truth doesn't always have the right PR tone to it. Despite what I just said, below is a table of every NAND device OCZ ships in its Vertex 2 and Vertex 3 products:</p><table align=center border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=1 width=575><tbody readability=1><tr class=tgrey readability=2><td align=center colspan=5>OCZ Vertex 2 & Vertex 3 NAND Usage</td></tr><tr class=tlblue><td width=120>&nbsp;</td><td align=center valign=middle width=85>Process Node</td><td align=center valign=middle width=85>Capacities</td></tr><tr><td class=tlgrey>Intel L63B</td><td align=center valign=middle>34nm</td><td align=center valign=middle>Up to 240GB</td></tr><tr><td class=tlgrey>Micron L63B</td><td align=center valign=middle>34nm</td><td align=center valign=middle>Up to 480GB</td></tr><tr><td class=tlgrey>Spectek L63B</td><td align=center valign=middle>34nm</td><td align=center valign=middle>240GB to 360GB</td></tr><tr><td class=tlgrey>Hynix</td><td align=center valign=middle>32nm</td><td align=center valign=middle>Up to 120GB</td></tr><tr><td class=tlgrey>Micron L73A</td><td align=center valign=middle>25nm</td><td align=center valign=middle>Up to 120GB</td></tr><tr><td class=tlgrey>Micron L74A</td><td align=center valign=middle>25nm</td><td align=center valign=middle>160GB to 480GB</td></tr><tr><td class=tlgrey>Intel L74A</td><td align=center valign=middle>25nm</td><td align=center valign=middle>160GB to 480GB</td></tr></tbody></table><p>The data came from OCZ and I didn't have to sneak around to get it, it was given to me by Alex Mei, Executive Vice President of OCZ.</p><p>You've seen the end result, now let me explain how we got here.</p><p>OCZ accidentally sent me a 120GB Vertex 2 built with 32nm Hynix NAND. I say it was an accident because the drive was supposed to be one of the new 25nm Vertex 2s, but there was a screwup in ordering and I ended up with this one. Here's a shot of its internals:</p><p align=center><a href=#><img border=0 height=413 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/reviews/storage/OCZ/Vertex3/120/smDSC_2662.jpg width=600 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>You'll see that there are a ton of NAND devices on the board. Thirty two to be exact. That's four per channel. Do the math and you'll see we've got 32 x 4GB 32nm MLC NAND die on the PCB. This drive has the same number of NAND die per package as the new 25nm 120GB Vertex 2 so in theory performance should be the same. It isn't however:</p><table align=center border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=1 width=575><tbody readability=3><tr class=tgrey readability=2><td align=center colspan=5>Vertex 2 NAND Performance Comparison</td></tr><tr class=tlblue readability=4><td width=120>&nbsp;</td><td align=center valign=middle width=85>AT Storage Bench Heavy 2011</td><td align=center valign=middle width=85>AT Storage Bench Light 2011</td></tr><tr><td class=tlgrey>34nm IMFT</td><td align=center valign=middle>120.1 MB/s</td><td align=center valign=middle>155.9 MB/s</td></tr><tr><td class=tlgrey>25nm IMFT</td><td align=center valign=middle>110.9 MB/s</td><td align=center valign=middle>145.8 MB/s</td></tr><tr><td class=tlgrey>32nm Hynix</td><td align=center valign=middle>92.1 MB/s</td><td align=center valign=middle>125.6 MB/s</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Performance is measurably worse. You'll notice that I also threw in some 34nm IMFT numbers to show just how far performance has fallen since the old launch NAND.</p><p>Why not just keep using 34nm IMFT NAND? Ultimately that product won't be available. It's like asking for 90nm CPUs today, the whole point to Moore's Law is to transition to smaller manufacturing processes as quickly as possible.</p><p>Why is the Hynix 32nm NAND so much slower? That part is a little less clear to me. For starters we're only dealing with one die per package, we've established can have a negative performance impact. On top of that, SandForce's firmware may only be optimized for a couple of NAND devices. OCZ admitted that around 90% of all Vertex 2 shipments use Intel or Micron NAND and as a result SandForce's firmware optimization focus is likely targeted at those NAND types first and foremost. There are differences in NAND interfaces as well as signaling speeds which could contribute to performance differences unless a controller takes these things into account.</p><p align=center><a href=#><img border=0 height=348 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/reviews/storage/OCZ/Vertex3/120/smDSC_2698.jpg width=600 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a><br>25nm Micron NAND</p><p>The 25nm NAND is slower than the 34nm offerings for a number of reasons. For starters page size increased from 4KB to 8KB with the transition to 25nm. Intel used this transition as a way to extract more performance out of the SSD 320, however that may have actually impeded SF-1200 performance as the firmware architecture wasn't designed around 8KB page sizes. I suspect SandForce just focused on compatibility here and not performance.</p><p>Secondly, 25nm NAND is physically slower than 34nm NAND:</p><table align=center border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=1 width=575><tbody readability=1><tr class=tgrey readability=2><td align=center colspan=5>NAND Performance Comparison</td></tr><tr class=tlblue><td width=120>&nbsp;</td><td align=center valign=middle width=85>Intel 34nm NAND</td><td align=center valign=middle width=85>Intel 25nm NAND</td></tr><tr><td class=tlgrey>Read</td><td align=center valign=middle>50 µs</td><td align=center valign=middle>50 µs</td></tr><tr><td class=tlgrey>Program</td><td align=center valign=middle>900 µs</td><td align=center valign=middle>1200 µs</td></tr><tr><td class=tlgrey>Block Erase</td><td align=center valign=middle>2 µs</td><td align=center valign=middle>3 µs</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Program and erase latency are both higher, although admittedly you're working with much larger page sizes (it's unclear whether Intel's 1200 µs figure is for a full page program or a partial program).</p><p>The bad news is that eventually all of the 34nm IMFT drives will dry up. The worse news is that the 25nm IMFT drives, even with the same number of NAND devices on board, are lower in performance. And the worst news is that the drives that use 32nm Hynix NAND are the slowest of them all.</p><p>I have to mention here that this issue isn't exclusive to OCZ. All other SF drive manufacturers are faced with the same potential problem as they too must shop around for NAND and can't guarantee that they will always ship the same NAND in every single drive.</p><h3>The Problem With Ratings</h3><p>You'll notice that although the three NAND types I've tested perform differently in our Heavy 2011 workload, a quick run through Iometer reveals that they perform identically:</p><table align=center border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=1 width=575><tbody readability=3><tr class=tgrey readability=2><td align=center colspan=5>Vertex 2 NAND Performance Comparison</td></tr><tr class=tlblue readability=4><td width=120>&nbsp;</td><td align=center valign=middle width=85>AT Storage Bench Heavy 2011</td><td align=center valign=middle width=85>Iometer 128KB Sequential Write</td></tr><tr><td class=tlgrey>34nm IMFT</td><td align=center valign=middle>120.1 MB/s</td><td align=center valign=middle>214.8 MB/s</td></tr><tr><td class=tlgrey>25nm IMFT</td><td align=center valign=middle>110.9 MB/s</td><td align=center valign=middle>221.8 MB/s</td></tr><tr><td class=tlgrey>32nm Hynix</td><td align=center valign=middle>92.1 MB/s</td><td align=center valign=middle>221.3 MB/s</td></tr></tbody></table><p>SandForce's architecture works by reducing the amount of data that actually has to be written to the NAND. When writing highly compressible data, not all NAND devices are active and we're not bound by the performance of the NAND itself since most of it is actually idle. SandForce is able to hide even significant performance differences between NAND implementations. This is likely why SandForce is more focused on NAND compatibility than performance across devices from all vendors.</p><p>Let's see what happens if we write incompressible data to these three drives however:</p><table align=center border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=1 width=575><tbody readability=3><tr class=tgrey readability=2><td align=center colspan=5>Vertex 2 NAND Performance Comparison</td></tr><tr class=tlblue readability=4><td width=120>&nbsp;</td><td align=center valign=middle width=85>Iometer 128KB Sequential Write (Incompressible Data)</td><td align=center valign=middle width=85>Iometer 128KB Sequential Write</td></tr><tr><td class=tlgrey>34nm IMFT</td><td align=center valign=middle>136.6 MB/s</td><td align=center valign=middle>214.8 MB/s</td></tr><tr><td class=tlgrey>25nm IMFT</td><td align=center valign=middle>118.5 MB/s</td><td align=center valign=middle>221.8 MB/s</td></tr><tr><td class=tlgrey>32nm Hynix</td><td align=center valign=middle>95.8 MB/s</td><td align=center valign=middle>221.3 MB/s</td></tr></tbody></table><p>It's only when you force SandForce's controller to write as much data in parallel as possible that you see the performance differences between NAND vendors. As a result, the label on the back of your Vertex 2 box isn't lying - whether you have 34nm IMFT, 25nm IMFT or 32nm Hynix the drive will actually hit the same peak performance numbers. The problem is that the metrics depicted on the spec sheets aren't adequate to be considered fully honest.</p><p>A quick survey of all SF-1200 based drives shows the same problem. Everyone rates according to maximum performance specifications and no one provides any hint of what you're actually getting inside the drive.</p><table align=center border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=1 width=575><tbody readability=3><tr class=tgrey readability=2><td align=center colspan=5>SF-1200 Drive Rating Comparison</td></tr><tr class=tlblue readability=4><td width=120>120GB Drive</td><td align=center valign=middle width=85>Rated Sequential Read Speed</td><td align=center valign=middle width=85>Rated Sequential Write Speed</td></tr><tr><td class=tlgrey>Corsair Force F120</td><td align=center valign=middle>285 MB/s</td><td align=center valign=middle>275 MB/s</td></tr><tr><td class=tlgrey>G.Skill Phoenix Pro</td><td align=center valign=middle>285 MB/s</td><td align=center valign=middle>275 MB/s</td></tr><tr><td class=tlgrey>OCZ Vertex 2</td><td align=center valign=middle>Up to 280 MB/s</td><td align=center valign=middle>Up to 270 MB/s</td></tr></tbody></table><p>I should stop right here and mention that specs are rarely all that honest on the back of any box. Whether we're talking about battery life or SSD performance, if specs told the complete truth then I'd probably be out of a job. If one manufacturer is totally honest, its competitors will just capitalize on the aforementioned honesty by advertising better looking specs. And thus all companies are forced to bend the truth because if they don't, someone else will.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7orrAp5utnZOde6S7zGiqoaenZIFzgZVoq6GdXaSwu3nVnqmtnahigG6%2BxK%2Bgnq9dZn9xs8Foag%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./deichmann-se-mike-deichmann-obituary-and-death.html><span>←</span><span>Deichmann SE Mike Deichmann Obituary And Death Cause</span></a>
