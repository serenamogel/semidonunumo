<span>Reinaldo Massengill</span></p><h1>Is Conan Gray Gay?</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>Everybody knows<strong> Conan Gray</strong>, the singer of the song <i>Heather, </i>who has reached a milestone in the music industry after making it on YouTube. Gray who is in his 20s is an aspiring singer and songwriter. Besides that, he's an American YouTuber and vlogger renowned for his cover song videos.</p><p>The young music star, Gray began his journey as a YouTuber in 2013, and since then, he has been delivering exciting content to his viewers. As of now, Gray amassed around 3.7 million subscribers on his YouTube channel.</p><p>Although Gray's doing great in the music industry, one controversy arises about him, fortunately not his art, but his sexuality.&nbsp;</p><h2>Is YouTube Star Conan Gray Gay?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2021/3/7/is-conan-gray-gay-1604873070-view-1%20(1)-1615135776297.jpg><p>A question frequently asked by many about&nbsp;<strong>Conan Gray&nbsp;</strong>is; Is the young YouTube star gay? And no, Gray is not gay. Because many talked a lot about his sexuality, the young YouTube star came in front back in August 2018 with the answer. He then announced he doesn't identify himself as gay via Twitter.</p><p>However, on December 3, 2019, Gray uploaded a picture of him and&nbsp;<a href=#><strong>Matty Healy</strong></a><strong>&nbsp;</strong>kissing, making many think he's gay. Moreover, media outlets assume he might be bisexual because Gray prefers both boys and girls as love partners in his music videos.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2021/3/7/Screenshot_5-1615135787594.jpg><p>Though in 2018, Gray said he isn't gay, several of his actions over the years speak otherwise, which made this topic spicier for many. So, what are those actions?</p><p>One of those acts can be Gray's relationship with his friend&nbsp;<strong>Ashley</strong>. According to Live Ramp Up, the&nbsp;<i>Maniac&nbsp;</i>singer noted his friend Ashley as his boyfriend, which hints that he's gay/bisexual.&nbsp;</p><p>However, the young artist dating his good friend Ashley isn't confirmed by either of them; due to this, no one can say anything for sure. Further, Gray's late 2019 post created more speculation on his sexuality.</p><p><i><strong>Also Read: </strong></i><a href=# rel=nofollow><i><strong>Is Rickey Smiley Married? Know About His Guy Rumors, Family, and Kids</strong></i></a></p><h2>Conan Gray Slow Transformation Throughout His Music Video Heather&nbsp;</h2><figure class=media></figure><p>One of Conan Gray's recent music videos is&nbsp;<i>Heather</i>, which was about his high school crush who desired another girl named Heather over him.</p><p>In that video, we can see Gray switching his dress up from masculine to feminine, and in a press statement, he even said; he made the slow transformation throughout the video (<i>Heather</i>) to represent the feminine and masculine traits he constantly switched between to become who he knew his crush would like. Somebody soft and sweet. Somebody like Heather.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2>Conan's Controversial Tweet About Being Lesbian</h2><p>As noted by <a href=# rel=nofollow>Know Your Meme</a>, in 2018, Conan Gray wrote a tweet that reads, "Boys r ugly and so stinky that's why I'm a lesbian!" And on April 19, 2020, a Twitter user named @oddeyejeno screen-shot Gray's 2018 tweet and commented, "@conangray so brave saying this then a few minutes later it's 'tweets aren't loading right now."&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2021/3/7/Screenshot_6-1615135754534.jpg><p>Soon that screen shot created fuzz, and even Gray responded to the tweet where he wrote, "realized the tweet was extremely dumb. learned that it perpetuates a stereotype that is harming the lgbtq+ community, which is the opposite of what i want to do. was a big mistake."&nbsp;</p><p><i>Maniac </i>singer Gray removed his tweet where he wrote about being a lesbian. However, the action was not surprising since it caused quite chaos among his fans on social media.&nbsp;</p><p>Since the singer already stated that he is not gay and that he is a lesbian, any intelligent person would understand that the artist is trying to say that he likes girls, however, giving a satire from his statement that "boys are ugly and stinky" that boys are jerks and not his type. So whatever others may have to say, the facts revealed by Gray point out that he is straight.</p><p><strong>Follow </strong><a href=#><strong>Married Celeb</strong></a> for more exciting articles.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmilkae%2FqrHDnJylnZJjsLC5jqKqZpufo66vecarmLJll5bG</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./is-youngboy-gay-get-more-information-about-him.html><span>←</span><span>Is Youngboy Gay?
