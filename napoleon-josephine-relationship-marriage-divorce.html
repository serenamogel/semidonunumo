Among other things, the couple argued over money and experienced a prolonged struggle to produce an heir. Ultimately, these hardships drove them apart and led them both to rather unsatisfying fates.</p><h2 data-node-id=5 class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Josephine had a humble upbringing</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">More than three decades before she met and received her now famous name from Napoleon, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://en.chateauversailles.fr/discover/history/great-characters/josephine-beauharnais#rose-tascher-de-la-pagerie data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Josephine was born" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Josephine was born</a> Marie-Joseph-Rose Tascher de la Pagerie on June 23, 1763, on the Tros-Îlets plantation in Martinique (the eastern Caribbean island is now a formal French territory overseas). Originally called Rose for short or affectionately Yeyette, she was the eldest daughter of Joseph Gaspard de Tascher, a sugar planter, and Rose-Claire Des Vergers de Sannois.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">According to Ernest John Knapton’s <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Gazetteer/People/Josephine/KNAEJO/2*.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="1963 book Empress Josephine," class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">1963 book Empress Josephine,</a> the future empress resided with her family in the plantation’s sugar refinery after a hurricane destroyed their home and killed 440 people in 1766.

They weren’t concerned about their daughter’s own enrichment but rather wanted to make her a suitable partner for marrying into a rich family. In December 1779, that plan came to fruition when Joseph escorted a 16-year-old Josephine to France for her marriage to Alexandre de Beauharnais.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The couple lived in the Paris suburbs and had two children: a son named Eugéne in 1781 and a daughter named Hortense in 1783. However, their relationship quickly soured, and they separated in 1785, with Josephine eventually taking her daughter back to Martinique and Alexandre taking custody of Eugéne.</p><h2 data-node-id=11 class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Josephine met Napoleon after avoiding the guillotine</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Josephine returned to France with Hortense in 1790 following the start of the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.history.com/topics/european-history/french-revolution data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="French Revolution" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">French Revolution</a> and a related slave revolt in Martinique. There, she reconnected with Alexandre, as they never officially divorced. He was a successful politician by this time and rose to lead the Constituent Assembly in 1791 before assuming a leadership position in the army.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Three years later, he and Josephine were <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://en.chateauversailles.fr/discover/history/great-characters/josephine-beauharnais#rose-tascher-de-la-pagerie data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="both arrested" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">both arrested</a> amid the Reign of Terror.

The latter introduced Josephine to an aspiring general named Napoleon Bonaparte at a party in 1795. While he was quickly smitten and proposed by January 1796, Josephine didn’t exactly give a glowing endorsement of her new beau—<a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.pbs.org/empires/napoleon/n_josephine/courtship/page_1.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="pointing out he was" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">pointing out he was</a> “silent and awkward with women” as well as “altogether strange in all his person.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">However, she ultimately saw the social and financial advantages Napoleon’s growing prestige could provide and agreed to his proposal. They were married in a civil ceremony on March 9, 1796, but the honeymoon would have to wait. Two days later, Napoleon departed for his first military campaign through Italy.<br></p><h2 data-node-id=17 class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Infidelity and family tension marked their marriage</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Although Josephine benefitted financially from her husband’s conquests on the battlefield, their long separations produced immediate tension in the relationship. Both she and Napoleon <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.napoleon.org/en/young-historians/napodoc/limperatrice-josephine-1763-1814 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="engaged in extramarital affairs" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">engaged in extramarital affairs</a>, and Napoleon had at least two children out of wedlock by 1810.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=30 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Josephine also spent money freely, angering Napoleon. She threw lavish parties at the Tuileries Palace and built a wardrobe of the finest clothes. In 1799, she purchased their Malmaison home near Paris and transformed it with beautiful rose gardens and exotic animals like kangaroos and ostriches. Although Napoleon often confronted Josephine over their bills, her charm and public perception ultimately assuaged him. “I win battles, but Josephine wins hearts,” <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.napoleon.org/en/young-historians/napodoc/limperatrice-josephine-1763-1814 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="he said" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">he said</a>.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=31 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Still, despite their trysts and disagreements, it’s clear Napoleon cared for Josephine very much. He lamented their lack of correspondence in his letters from the battlefield. “I cannot even drink a cup of tea without cursing the glory and the ambition which keep me apart from the soul of my existence,” <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Gazetteer/People/Josephine/KNAEJO/10*.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="he once wrote" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">he once wrote</a>.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=32 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Napoleon also attempted to unite the Bonaparte and Beauharnais families, adopting Eugéne and allowing his brother Louis to marry his stepdaughter Hortense. At his coronation as emperor in 1804, he insisted on being the one to crown his wife empress—a public show of support in the midst of mounting pressure from his own relatives to split with Josephine.</p><h6 class="css-9e7625 e9ikml3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e9ikml1">Other French Monarchs</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><h2 data-node-id=34 class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Josephine couldn’t give Napoleon an heir</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=35 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The resentment of the Bonaparte family stemmed primarily from Josephine’s inability to bear them children and, thus, an heir. Knowing it could ultimately lead to the end of their marriage, she felt this burden as well.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=36 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10"><a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.ogmagazine.org.au/14/4-14/josephines-tubes/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="According to O&G Magazine" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">According to O&G Magazine</a>, a desperate Josephine traveled to the spa town of Plombières in modern day Belgium in 1798 at the suggestion of Napoleon’s doctor. Her sister-in-law had done the same and became pregnant with a daughter after six years of infertility. But despite multiple visits, Josephine never experienced such a reversal of fortune.</p><img alt="an engraving depicting napoleon talking to his crying wife and assistants" title="A 1879 drawing of Napoleon Bonaparte and Empress Josephine on the eve of their divorce" width=1024 height=766 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/napoleon-announces-to-josephine-the-scheduled-day-for-news-photo-1700058708.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-eqbp25 eewc14j1">Getty Images</span><p>A depiction of Napoleon, right, revealing his intention to divorce Empress Josephine in 1809.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=38 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Once Napoleon was crowned emperor in 1804, he also grew more impatient with her infertility.

Josephine begrudgingly agreed, and their marriage was officially annulled weeks later on December 15.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=39 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Despite their often contentious union, Napoleon promised to safeguard Josephine’s future. “I want her to keep the rank and title of empress, but I definitely do not want her to doubt my feelings and want her always to consider me as her best and dearest friend,” he said, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.napoleon.org/en/young-historians/napodoc/limperatrice-josephine-1763-1814 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="according to the Foundation Napoleon" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">according to the Foundation Napoleon</a>.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=40 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Josephine settled down for good at Malmaison, making improvements to the house, tending to the gardens, and expanding her art collection.</p><h2 data-node-id=41 class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Josephine and Napoleon cared for each other until death</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=42 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10"><a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.pbs.org/empires/napoleon/n_josephine/newlife/page_1.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="According to PBS" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">According to PBS</a>, Napoleon, now about 40 years old, immediately began searching for a new wife. His ideal candidate was Anna Pavlovna, the 15-year-old sister of Russian Tsar Alexander I. But after his proposal was met with delays and excuses, he instead chose Archduchess Marie-Louise of Austria due largely to political motivations. Despite the 19-year-old Marie-Louise’s initial fears and objections—<a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.pbs.org/empires/napoleon/n_josephine/newlife/page_1.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="she wrote in her diary" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">she wrote in her diary</a> that simply seeing Napoleon would be “the worst form of torture”—she married him in a civil ceremony in April 1810.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=43 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Within a year, Marie-Louise gave birth to an heir, Napoleon II, who received the title king of Rome. Still, Napoleon kept his promise to Josephine, continuing to write her letters and sometimes showing up unannounced to see her—sparking jealousy in his new wife.</p><h6 class="css-9e7625 e9ikml3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e9ikml1">Other Famous Royal Relationships</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=45 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">At Malmaison, Josephine followed the deteriorating state of her ex-husband’s rule, with Russia and its allies invading France in 1814.
