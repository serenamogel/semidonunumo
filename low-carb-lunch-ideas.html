It’s easily my least favorite meal to prepare. It’s somehow less socially acceptable to eat the same thing on repeat like you can with breakfast and you have less time to put it together than a well-planned-out dinner. If you’re trying to avoid carbs? Good freaking luck; you can kiss classics like sandwiches goodbye! Thankfully, we can get a little creative with the situation and still find easy (okay, sometimes easy-ish) low carb lunch ideas when you need to get back to “the grind” (barf).</p><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Tonnino Tuna Fillets with Garlic in Olive Oil</strong></a><p>These tuna fillets are an easy way to get just an ungodly amount of flavor into your mouth in the most efficient way possible, and that makes them one of the best low carb lunch ideas. Sporked contributor Danny Palumbo says the garlic smacks you in the face and the extra virgin olive oil rich and silky. You could absolutely go to town on a jar of these over the office sink, but, please, if you have the extra time, throw together a low-carb nicoise salad. You won’t regret it.</p><strong><a href=# rel=noopener>C. Worthy & Co. Blackened Salmon</a> + <a href=# rel=noopener>Green Giant Riced Veggies Cauliflower</a></strong><p>Okay, this is a low carb lunch idea for people who work from home. Sure, there are smellier fish out there than salmon, but throw cauliflower into the mix of office microwave smells and you’re playing with fire. That said, this is a great low carb lunch.You don’t even have to thaw the salmon if you forgot to put it in the fridge overnight. Just pop one of these frozen salmon fillets in the oven, then throw your bag of riced cauliflower into the microwave when there are a few minutes left, and that’s lunch, as they say.</p><strong>Salad with <a href=# rel=noopener>Chosen Foods Lemon Garlic Dressing</a> + <a href=# rel=noopener>Mt. Vikos Traditional Feta</a></strong><p>Salads can be a daunting to throw together in the middle of a workday but if you want it to be super flavorful without much effort, good dressing and tangy cheese are key. This low sugar dressing is bursting with garlic and citrus. As Sporked‘s managing editor put it, you’ll have “absolutely kickin’ breath” after you eat this dressing, but that’s why Wisps exist. And, hey, since croutons don’t fit into a low carb lunch, you have to get your good garlicky flavor where you can.</p><strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Fage Total 5% Greek Yogurt</a> + <a href=# rel=noopener>Maisie Jane’s Crunchy Almond Butter</a></strong><p>This is a low carb lunch idea rather than carb free lunch idea, so it may not fit into everyone’s diet. But for those of you willing to ball out on 5 grams of carbs per serving, you’ll be glad you did. Fage’s full fat Greek yogurt is “extremely thick and creamy and downright decadent” so you could eat it on its own but that seems like more of a snack to me. Level it up to a fully fledged lunch with a spoonful of Maisie Jane’s Crunchy Almond Butter mixed into your bowl. Maisie Jane’s added crunch factor makes yogurt more like a meal and the added protein fills you up for longer. If you’re really looking for the quickest low-carb lunch that still tastes good, this is the pick for you.</p><a href=#><strong>Bubba Burgers Angus Beef</strong></a><p>When it comes to low carb lunch ideas, a burger in the middle of the day may seem like the biggest hassle imaginable, but let me tell you the secret magic to these patties: they can be cooked in a pan straight out of the freezer. There’s no added stress of thawing and, truthfully, I love cooking frozen burger patties. They’re pre-formed and harder to overcook than their raw counterparts. A plain burger for lunch can be pretty pitiful so be sure to dress these up with some fixin’s or throw a lettuce bun around it and treat it like a normal burger.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiroKS%2FrLHDZ5qopV%2BWv7W1wqWcaKSfrHqkrdGbZKWtnpi1brXDnpisZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./amd-announces-radeon-rx-5500-series-for-desktop-and-mobile.html><span>←</span><span>1080p Gaming for Desktop &amp;amp; Mobile, Coming This Quarter</span></a>
