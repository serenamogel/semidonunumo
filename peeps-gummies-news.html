What do these Peep-adjacent gummy candies look and taste like? At first, I assumed the form would mimic the classic Peeps marshmallows. Boy, was I only half right. The new confections are bite-sized (unlike the 1.5 bite-sized original Peeps. I measured.) and come in three shapes/flavors: yellow chicks (marshmallow flavor), blue bunnies (blue raspberry marshmallow flavor), and pink bunnies (strawberry marshmallow flavor). And sweet-toothed readers, don’t worry, each gummy is absolutely&nbsp;covered&nbsp;in sugar, much like their marshmallowy cousin.</p><p>Let’s pause and take a closer look at the flavors. One of those gummies is blue raspberry marshmallow flavored. Blue raspberry marshmallow. It&nbsp;creates some cognitive dissonance for me. I think of blue raspberry as being a distinctly tart and aggressively fruity flavor, while I think of marshmallow flavor as vanilla-y, powdery, and cloyingly sweet. I’ll admit it’s hard to imagine those two mixing, but given that blue raspberry is the king of all flavors and is never bad (yes, this is a fact), it’s hard to imagine this flavor combo failing.</p><p>Bottom line, I really need to go out and try these gummies because I’m tired of the sleepless nights frantically trying to imagine what a blue raspberry marshmallow flavored Peep gummy tastes like. And, of course, I’m excited to try the other flavors too, so Peep me in the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Easter candy</a> aisle this week, on the hunt for some&nbsp;very&nbsp;sweet gummies.&nbsp;</p><p>Try them yourself and let us know what you think!
