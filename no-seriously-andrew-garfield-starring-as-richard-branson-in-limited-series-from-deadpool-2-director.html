As per <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Deadline</a>, the 38 year-old is set to star as billionaire tycoon, entrepreneur, and all-round Virgin overlord Richard Branson in limited series up Hot Air, which is set to be directed by John Wick, Atomic Blonde, Deadpool 2, Hobbs & Shaw, and Bullet Train‘s David Leitch.</p><p data-characters=374 data-current-count=374 data-injectable=false>Garfield and Branson look nothing alike, and Leitch has spent his entire professional career kicking ass as either a stuntman, producer, and director, so this is nothing if not a bizarrely unusual combination. The initial report says that a bidding war is already underway, but as of yet it hasn’t secured a home, although streamers will be throwing money at this one.</p><p data-characters=250 data-current-count=624 data-injectable=false>The story will follow the rise of Branson’s Virgin Airlines, and based on the title, it’ll also take a detour into his hot air balloon adventures, too. It’s quite the combination, so we’ve definitely got this one on our radar.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3yvu4ysnKuhn6rArcWMmqWdqpWseqit0Z%2BgnqSUYsC1rdGroKefXZbAbr7InJ%2BaqpRir7Otzaymp2WZo3qttcyiq56cXaiys7XErGSfqp%2BieqWxwJ2nqKecYn9usMirnJysn6d8</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-is-tiktok-star-chris-olsen-ethnicity-parents-family-and-religion.html><span>←</span><span>What Is TikTok Star Chris Olsen Ethnicity?
