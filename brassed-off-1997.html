<span>Reinaldo Massengill</span></p><h1>Brassed Off movie review &amp;amp; film summary (1997)</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>"Brassed Off'' is a film that views the survival of the town through the survival of the band, and the survival of the band through the eyes of Danny (<a href=#>Pete Postlethwaite</a>), who in some corner of his mind probably believes the mines exist only to supply him with musicians. The movie makes liberal use of storytelling formulas (there is a love story involving young people, and a crisis involving a married couple, and a health crisis involving Danny, a strategic use of "Danny Boy,'' and a national band contest at the Royal <a href=#>Albert Hall</a>). But Postlethwaite's performance elevates and even ennobles this material.</p><p>He loves music. He is stern and exacting about it. His band members may labor in the pits all day, but when they come to rehearsal he expects seriousness and concentration. There is a 14-town competition coming up, and then the national finals, and this year he thinks the Grimley Brass Band has a real chance. If the pit closes, it will be a last chance.</p><p>Into the rehearsal hall one day comes a pretty young woman named Gloria (<a href=#>Tara Fitzgerald</a>), who asks if she can sit in with her flugelhorn. She can. Her late father had been the band's best flugelhorn player, and her performance of "Rodrigo's Concerto'' brings tears to the eyes of some of the band members--and a sparkle to the eye of young Andy (<a href=#>Ewan McGregor</a>, from "Trainspotting"), who had a crush on her in school. Now she has gone away to London, and returned to Grimley (we learn) to make a study about the pit closure.</p><p>She pretends to have forgotten Andy, but later admits, "I did know your name--I just didn't want you to think it was etched forever on my brain.'' The love they felt when they were 14 blossoms again, until it is revealed that she is working for the other side--for the government agency that would close the mine. She protests that she is on the miners' side, and that her study might save the pit, but is told scornfully, "It's just a bloody PR exercise.. They've already made their decision while you were at bloody college.'' Another important figure the story is Phil (<a href=#>Stephen Tompkinson</a>), Danny's son, who struggles to make ends meet for his wife and large family. He wants to quit the band in order to save paying the dues, but lacks the nerve to tell his father. Phil moonlights as Chuckles the Clown, and brings a quick end to a children's birthday party with an uncontrolled outburst against Margaret Thatcher.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46bqZqro5qxbrvFn2RqcWls</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./viktoria-nasyrova-and-olga-tsvyk-cheesecake-murder.html><span>←</span><span>Viktoria Nasyrova And Olga Tsvyk Doppelgnger Cheesecake Murder Case Update- Arrest And Charges</span></a>
