In July 2019, she was finally brought to trial in New York City, where she faced charges of attempted murder, burglary, and assault.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>During the trial, prosecutors presented evidence that Nasyrova had drugged her friend and counterpart, Olga Tsvyk, with a cake laced with a sedative to steal her identity and assets. Tsvyk survived the incident but suffered from memory loss and other health issues.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The investigators found phenazepam, a potent sedative, in the cheesecake crumbs left in the container. The trial lasted nearly two months, during which the prosecution called several witnesses to testify about Nasyrova’s history of financial fraud and identity theft.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The defense argued that there was insufficient evidence to link Nasyrova to the crime and suggested that Tsvyk may have been suffering from a pre-existing medical condition.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>In August 2019, the jury found Nasyrova guilty of all charges, including attempted murder, burglary, and assault.
