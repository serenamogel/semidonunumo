this very day, I tried to take my own life. And I said, “Zach, do it in front of your co-workers and end the misery.” I don’t know how many of you ever tried to jump off of a Pizza Hut, but you’ll just get a sprained ankle out of the deal. Then you’ll have to go back inside, and serve crazy bread.” <strong>– Zach Galifianakis&nbsp;</strong></p><p>“I have never been much of a groomer.I’ve had women smell me and say that should be bottled. I would advise guys to lay off the Drakkar, because the cavemen weren’t wearing it. They might have been putting mint leaves on their balls, but your scent is grown naturally. I have really good dating advice.” <strong>– Zach Galifianakis&nbsp;</strong></p><p>“I’m the most mellow person offstage. I think it’s just, going onstage lets me get out some frustration that I’m too shy to do in real life. Instead of doing it in private, I’d rather do it in front of 1,000 people who’ve paid $25 to see me lose my mind.” <strong>– Zach Galifianakis&nbsp;</strong></p><p>“I watch a happy person doing stand-up, and I go, “What the hell is this? This person’s happy!” You need internal conflict. You need the guy to be out of step with society. It’s a tool for comedy.” <strong>– Zach Galifianakis&nbsp;</strong></p><p>“People get TV deals by doing something in their grandmother’s basement. It is definitely the wave. Everybody is trying to do all that stuff. I mean, the Internet is the only reason that I’ve gotten work is because I’ve somehow created a line and people have seen it. And then I’ve been asked to auditions.” <strong>– Zach Galifianakis&nbsp;</strong></p><p>View our larger collection of the best <a href=# data-lasso-id=6654 data-wpel-link=internal>Zach Galifianakis quotes</a>!</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=frequently-asked-questions></span><strong>Frequently Asked Questions</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h3><strong>How much is Zach Galifianakis worth?</strong></h3><p>Zach Galifianakis’ net worth is estimated to be $40 Million.<br>&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>How old is Zach Galifianakis?</strong></h3><p>Zach Galifianakis was born on October 1, 1969, and is currently 54 years old.<br>&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>How tall is Zach Galifianakis?</strong></h3><p>Zach Galifianakis’ height is 1.70 m, which is equal to 5 ft 7 in.<br>&nbsp;</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=summary></span><strong>Summary</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Zach Galifianakis’ net worth has increased since he made his breakthrough in the comedy ‘The Hangover’ alongside Bradley Cooper and Ed Helms.</p><p>Since then, he has become a household name in film and comedy.</p><p>As of February 2024, Zach Galifianakis’ net worth is estimated to be roughly $40 Million.</p><h3>What do you think about&nbsp;Zach Galifianakis’ net worth?
