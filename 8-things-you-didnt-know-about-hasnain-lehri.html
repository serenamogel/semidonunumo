Spoiled Child</h3>In one of his interviews, Hasnain revealed that he comes from a wealthy family. As a result, he was his parents’ spoiled child.

And now he’s here, dazzling the audience. <span class=footnote_referrer><a role=button tabindex=0 onclick='footnote_moveToReference_218996_1("footnote_plugin_reference_218996_1_1")' onkeypress='footnote_moveToReference_218996_1("footnote_plugin_reference_218996_1_1")' href=#>[1]</a><span id=footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_218996_1_1 class=footnote_tooltip></span></span><h3>2. A Sensitive Guy</h3>According to him, he is a sensitive guy who puts his heart on his sleeves. His friends know this about him and they tell him that it’s his biggest strength and also his biggest weakness.<h3>3. His Mentor</h3>He considers Abdullah Haris and Rizwan Ul Haq his biggest mentor. As he told that he’s learned a lot from these two. Not only this but he also considers Abdullah Haris as his own father.<h3>4.

Loses Weight For Modeling</h3>Lehri adds that he did lose weight when he started modeling, this is pretty irrelevant, as male models in Pakistan tend to bulk up in order to make a name for themselves in the industry. Lehri believes that in order to meet international standards, male models must maintain a lean and svelte physique because it adds more diversity.<h3>6. Troubles During His Initial Career</h3>It wasn’t all fun and games for this model, who had his fair share of difficulties when he first entered the industry. In relation to the casting couch, Lehri explained how hard work helped him avoid having to use such means to make it big.<h3>7. Bullied By Senior Models</h3>Many senior models even bullied him at first “I’ve been told I’m ugly and will never be a model. During a show, one model even told me that people were laughing at me as I walked down the runway. I knew that wasn’t the case.” He laughs as he recalls this incident.<h3>8. Achievements</h3>As a male model, Hasnain Lehri is the only supermodel to have won five LUX Style Awards in the history of Pakistani fashion/entertainment. He also set a record by receiving four consecutive awards at the Lux Style Awards, (Winning Year) LSA 2015, 2016, 2017, and 2018, and again at LSA 2020. <span class=footnote_referrer><a role=button tabindex=0 onclick='footnote_moveToReference_218996_1("footnote_plugin_reference_218996_1_3")' onkeypress='footnote_moveToReference_218996_1("footnote_plugin_reference_218996_1_3")' href=#>[3]</a><span id=footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_218996_1_3 class=footnote_tooltip></span></span><p><span role=button tabindex=0 class="footnote_reference_container_label pointer" onclick=footnote_expand_collapse_reference_container_218996_1()>References</span><span role=button tabindex=0 class=footnote_reference_container_collapse_button onclick=footnote_expand_collapse_reference_container_218996_1()>[<a id=footnote_reference_container_collapse_button_218996_1 href=#>+</a>]</span></p><table class="footnotes_table footnote-reference-container">References<tbody><tr class=footnotes_plugin_reference_row><th scope=row class="footnote_plugin_index_combi pointer" onclick='footnote_moveToAnchor_218996_1("footnote_plugin_tooltip_218996_1_1")'><a id=footnote_plugin_reference_218996_1_1 class=footnote_backlink href=#><span class=footnote_index_arrow>↑</span>1</a></th><td class=footnote_plugin_text><a href=# rel=noopener>OK Pakistan</a></td></tr><tr class=footnotes_plugin_reference_row><th scope=row class="footnote_plugin_index_combi pointer" onclick='footnote_moveToAnchor_218996_1("footnote_plugin_tooltip_218996_1_2")'><a id=footnote_plugin_reference_218996_1_2 class=footnote_backlink href=#><span class=footnote_index_arrow>↑</span>2</a></th><td class=footnote_plugin_text><a href=# rel=noopener>The News</a></td></tr><tr class=footnotes_plugin_reference_row><th scope=row class="footnote_plugin_index_combi pointer" onclick='footnote_moveToAnchor_218996_1("footnote_plugin_tooltip_218996_1_3")'><a id=footnote_plugin_reference_218996_1_3 class=footnote_backlink href=#><span class=footnote_index_arrow>↑</span>3</a></th><td class=footnote_plugin_text><a href=# rel=noopener>Wikipedia</a></td></tr></tbody></table><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpaWys7%2FTmqmsmpmke6S7zGiZoqejZLumw9Job2asmJ67qL%2BMsqauZZSesa%2FAjKSlqK9dlq%2BwwdNmn5qrnpa2r3nLnp%2BroV8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./miya-cech.html><span>←</span><span>Miya Cech Biography, Facts &amp;amp; Life Story</span></a>
