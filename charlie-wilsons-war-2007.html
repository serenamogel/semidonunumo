<span>Larita Shotwell</span></p><h1>Charlie Wilson's War movie review (2007)</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>Here's how it all happened, told in a sharp-edged political comedy directed by <a href=#>Mike Nichols</a> and written by Aaron ("The West Wing") Sorkin. Charlie Wilson, whose personal life was shall we say untidy, was popular in the 2nd Congressional District of Texas because he never met a pork-barrel project he didn't like, especially if it meant federal funds for the 2nd Congressional District of Texas. Apart from that, nobody back home much cared that he was a good ol' boy who liked company in a hot tub and was rarely without a drink in his hand.</p><p>He had a soft spot for a right-wing Houston millionaire socialite named Joanne Herring (<a href=#>Julia Roberts</a>), a sometime TV talk-show hostess, who hated the commies and wanted them to stop killing the brave Afghans. She had some connections, since she was an honorary consul to Pakistan.</p><p>She told Charlie the Afghans need weapons to shoot down Russian helicopters. Since he was on the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, he was ideally placed to help them. Problem was, the United States couldn't afford to have American-made weapons found in Afghanistan. Herring's solution: The Israelis had lots of shoulder-mounted Soviet-made anti-aircraft weapons, which they could supply to the Afghans through the back channel of Pakistan? <i>What?</i> asks Charlie. Pakistan and Israel working together?</p><p>Herring arranges for Wilson to meet her personal friend General Zia, the military dictator of Pakistan, who hates the Russians as much as she does. Zia sends him on a heartbreaking tour of Pakistan's refugee camps for displaced Afghans. Charlie finds the one man in the CIA who can actually help him: The pot-bellied, chain-smoking, hard-drinking outsider Gust Avrakotos (<a href=#>Philip Seymour Hoffman</a>, with a squirrelly little mustache. Gust knows just the Israeli for them to talk to.</p><p>They will need money. The United States was then supplying the Afghan freedom fighters with a useless $5 million a year, but Charlie was a master at glad-handing, elbow-bending and calling in favors, and that amount was quietly raised to $1 billion a year, all secret, because it was CIA funding, you see. With the use of some personal diplomacy and a Texas belly-dancer flown from Houston to Cairo, Charlie pulls off the deal.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46cn5qqnJ6ybsPIpaqopqNixKK%2BjGtnaW8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./oscar-de-la-hoya-celebrates-birthday-underwear-holly-sonders.html><span>←</span><span> Oscar De La Hoya Celebrates Birthday In Underwear With Holly Sonders</span></a>
