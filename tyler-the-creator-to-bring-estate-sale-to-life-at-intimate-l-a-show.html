We’re good with rhythm. We know pockets. We hear a collection of sounds and one thing and say, ‘Ahh, I know what could go over this,’ that takes a skill,” he said. “You could be multiple choice. You could be into this and you could be into this, and you could be into that. It’s A,B,C.”</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>Tyler continued: “I’m a rapper. I’m also a producer. I’m also a fucking hot dog. You got some young kid like 13 thinking, ‘Oh I got to make bravado rap, [or] damn I gotta talk about what you think you would have to talk about in a rap song,’ [but] no, you don’t. When I’m flexing on these songs, it’s just about the shit that I really like.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmigmaW1sLzDsWWcp51ku6bD0mirsqSVp3q1tMRmmqudkam8s3nTqGSbqpmjtG6x0q2YrZ1dqK6tsYytpmakmZuybq3TZqCnrJmirrWxjKVkmmWjnby4</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./raghib-ismail.html><span>←</span><span>Raghib Ismail</span></a>
