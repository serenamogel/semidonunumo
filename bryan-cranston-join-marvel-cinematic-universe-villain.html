Instead, like many other actors, he’s actually far more interested in joining the Marvel Cinematic Universe.</p>[zergpaid]<p data-characters=504 data-current-count=734 data-injectable=true>“You know what I’d like to do? I’d like to do some big superhero villain in some Marvel classic,” Cranston revealed in a recent interview to promote his latest movie Trumbo. Interestingly though, it doesn’t sound as if he has much of an interest in playing a character from the comic books; instead, he’d much prefer to put his own spin on an original bad guy. “Create one from scratch… I don’t know what I would do but it would be nasty,” &nbsp;he teased.</p><p data-characters=325 data-current-count=325 data-injectable=false>Marvel Studios has certainly created some original villains (even if they’ve shared a name with an obscure character from the source material), and you have to believe they’d welcome someone like Cranston with open arms. With any luck, Kevin Feige has spotted these comments from him and is already working on it.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJomauxkaN6pL7Ap6qtp55it7C1zWakmqqmmrlur8innKaZpJ6wbsHNoq2eqqOaere1y6WYoqZf</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./vishal-kotian-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-248257-html.html><span>←</span><span>Vishal Kotian Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</span></a>
