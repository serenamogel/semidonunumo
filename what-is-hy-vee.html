Are you a busy snacker who needs easy, premade meals? It’s Trader Joe’s for you. Are you a family of 12 that appreciates exclusivity? Better renew your Costco membership. Do you have a strong sense of regional pride and are lucky enough to live in a place where one of those magical, near-perfect, local, unicorn grocery store chains operates? You probably have a very strong allegiance to Publix, Wegmans, HEB, or Hy-Vee and you will defend your store’s honor at the drop of a hat. Oh, you’re not familiar with Hy-Vee? Who owns that wonderful place? How many stores are there? And where is the Hy-Vee headquarters? Those are all great questions, and if you stop asking them for a minute I’ll answer them.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-what-is-hy-vee><strong>What is Hy-Vee?&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>I know it sounds like a really hard to hit musical note, but Hy-Vee is actually an employee owned grocery store with locations mostly in the midwest United States and slowly expanding into the South. The largest Hy-Vees are typical big supermarkets with everything you’d expect: bakeries, pharmacies, delis, and florists. Some also have decent priced gas stations.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-who-really-owns-hy-vee><strong>Who really owns Hy-Vee?</strong></h2><p>Many of the employees have a vested interest in the success of the company as direct or indirect stockholders, meaning the employees really do own the store. This seems to translate to happier, more helpful store associates, which makes shopping at Hy-Vee a more pleasant experience for customers. Appropriately, the company slogan is “A Helpful Smile in Every Aisle.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-how-many-hy-vee-stores-are-there><strong>How many Hy-Vee stores are there?&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>There are around 285 Hy-Vee stores at the time of this writing. The trick is to say “around” so that as a few new ones are built and people read this in the future, they can still be like, “Oh yeah, that’s technically correct.” Hy-Vee is generally a Midwest chain, with stores located in Iowa, Illinois, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, South Dakota, Wisconsin, and Indiana. But they also have stores in, or opening soon in a few southern states as well such as Kentucky, Tennessee, and Alabama.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-where-is-hy-vee-headquarters-located><strong>Where is Hy-Vee headquarters located?&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Hy-Vee headquarters is in West Des Moines, Iowa. Charles Hyde and David Vredenburg opened Hy-Vee’s first store in Beaconsfield, Iowa, in 1930. The men called their operation Hyde & Vredenburg, but in 1953 they held a contest to rename the stores and the winning entry combined the founders’ names to make the grocery store known as Char-Vid. No wait, I mean Hy-Vee.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiroKS%2FrLHDZ5qopV%2BWv7W1wqWcaK%2BYlsFutdJmn7JlppqycA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./list-of-references-to-pok-c3-a9mon-in-science.html><span>←</span><span>List of references to Pokmon in science</span></a>
