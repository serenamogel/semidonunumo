<span>Larita Shotwell</span></p><h1>Who is Brian J. White? His Wife, Family &amp;amp; Net Worth</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>Brian J. White is an African American actor, model, dancer, and producer who might be best recalled from his many TV roles which most notably includes Lieutenant Carl Davis in Moonlight and B613 Agent Franklin Russel in Scandal.</p><p>The Beta Theta Pi fraternity member, who has also starred in films like ‘The Family Stone’ (2005), ‘Stomp the Yard’ (2007) and ‘I Can Do Bad All By Myself’ (2009), is also a licensed stockbroker, following in the footsteps of his mother.</p><p>Read to find out more about White’s biography, family, wife, brother, and net worth.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=early-life-and-career></span><strong>Early Life and Career</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>White was born Brian Joseph White on the 21st of April, 1975 in Boston, Massachusetts. He is the eldest of six children born to Joseph Henry and Estelle Bowser White. His mother, Estelle, worked as a financial advisor while his father, popularly known as Jo Jo White, was a former Basketball player turned restauranteur.</p><p>He completed his high school education at Newton South High School before attending Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire, where he majored in political psychology and theatre arts. He also became a member of the Beta Theta Pi fraternity while in college. He had hopes of becoming a professional athlete like his father and was said to have played professional football for the New England Patriots of the National Football League. He also played professional lacrosse for the Boston Blazers in the National Lacrosse League before opting to become a full-time actor after suffering a career-ending injury.</p><p>He first started modelling and then co-founded a professional dance/theatre company named Phunk Phenomenon Urban Dance Theater Company. During this time, he also became a licensed stockbroker in order to stay afloat. White later got his big break and kicked off his acting career by appearing in television series’ like ‘Moesha’ (2000), where he played the role of Gabe in the sitcom and got rave reviews for his performances, ‘Second Time Around’ (2004) and ‘The Shield’ (2004). He, however, has an uncredited appearance in the 1999 movie ‘The Best Man’ where he appeared as an extra.</p><p>Brian went on to appear in several other television series and films such as ‘The Family Stone’ (2005), ‘Stomp the Yard’ (2007), ‘The Game Plan’ (2007), and ‘I Can Do Bad All By Myself’ (2009). He has most recently appeared in TV shows such as ‘Chicago Fire’, ‘Scandal’, ‘Mistresses’, and ‘Hawaii Five-0’.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=who-is-his-wife></span><strong>Who Is His Wife?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>White is married to Paula Da Silva. The couple exchanged vows in 2010 and have a daughter, named Layla Simone White, who was born four years later in 2014. Not much is known about White’s wife as they like to maintain a low profile.</p><h2></h2><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=facts-about-his-brother-and-father></span><strong>Facts About His Brother and Father</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Brian J. White’s father, Joseph Henry White, is a Hall of Fame basketball player for the Boston Celtics. He won two NBA championships during his ten-year stint at the franchise and also represented the U.S. Men’s Basketball team at the 1968 Summer Olympics. Jo Jo passed away on January 16, 2018, in Boston from complications of his dementia.</p><p>Brian is the eldest of his parents six children. It is, however, not clear how many brothers or sister he has. It has been said that actor Micheal Jai White and Brian are brothers but this is, in fact, false as Micheal is older than Brian while Brian is said to be the oldest of his siblings.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-is-his-net-worth></span><strong>What Is His Net Worth?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Brian J. White’s net worth is estimated to be around $1.5 million. This comes from his longstanding career as an actor and model as well as through the endorsement of brands like ABC.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-he-gay></span><strong>Is He Gay?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Rumor has swirled around Hollywood for a while now that Brian J. White is gay. It is unclear where exactly these rumors originated from as no one has specifically come out to accuse him of being their partner. He has, however, spoken out in support of gay people, especially those in the black community.</p><p>Brian’s numerous A-list, as well as B-list celebrity girlfriends, should help prove that he is not gay. He has in the past been dated supermodel Tyra Banks, actress Minka Kelly, model Natassia Malthe, and actress Valerie Pettiford among many others.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=other-facts></span><strong>Other Facts</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><strong>Birth Name:</strong> Brian Joseph White</p><p><strong>Place of Birth:</strong> Boston, Massachusetts, U.S.A.</p><p><strong>Birth Date:</strong> April 21, 1975</p><p><strong>Profession(s):</strong> Model, Actor, Producer, Stockbroker</p><p><strong>Nationality:</strong> American</p><p><strong>Height:</strong> 6 feet 2 inches</p><p><strong>Marital Status:</strong> Married – 2010</p><p><strong>Children:</strong> 1</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaK%2BYpHqqv4ybqaKZnmK3bsPHoqueZZiewG7DyJ%2BcZp6RoratxYynnK1lp6S%2FtbSO</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./how-much-was-comedian-paul-mooney-worth-at-the-time-of-his-death.html><span>←</span><span>How Much Was Comedian Paul Mooney Worth At The Time Of His Death?</span></a>
