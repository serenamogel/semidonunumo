His second was Belligerence and Debauchery: The Tucker Max Stories which he published in 2003. Max was the facilitator of the website “Tard Blog”. He worked as the facilitator for one year (2002-2003). Max in the year 2006, began the development of a television pilot for Comedy Central. However, the project was canceled as a dispute arose with sony about feature film rights.</p><p>Simon Spotlight Publishing which is a division of Simon & Schuster in September the year 2006 announced that Tucker was contracted to release a book in January 2008 titled Assholes Finish First. The book however deleted to be published for some undisclosed reasons. It was then pushed to September 2010. Max is reported to have received a $300,000 advance for Asshole Finish First. He d released a revised and expanded edition of I Hope They Serve Beer in Hell in January 2009.</p><p>The Hollywood Reporter in the year 2008 announced that Max was going to produce a movie that was based on his best-selling book. The movie was t6o be titled I Hope They Serve Beer in Hell.&nbsp; Max detailed the process on a production blog hosted on the movie’s website. Matt Czuchry (The Good Wife) who is an actor portrayed Max in the film. However, the film was panned by critics. It gained $1.4 million at the box office on a $7 million budget. Tucker attributed the poor box office performance of the film to oversights in marketing. He, however, had hopes that it would find an audience on DVD.</p><p>Max in the year 2011 was a guest speaker at the Ancestral Health Symposium. He gave a presentation entitled From cave to cage: Mixed martial arts in ancestral health. Mas in January 2012, said that he was leaving behind the lifestyle he had described in his books. He said that he has been in psychotherapy. A publicity campaign for his book Hilarity Ensues in February 2012 led to his account with the company Sponsored Tweets being banned for “ethics violations”.</p><p>Max started collaborating starting summer 2014 with Dr. Geoffrey Miller. They collaborated on a podcast called The Mating Grounds. Max alongside Dr. Miller in September 2015 released Mate: Become the Man Women Want. &nbsp;Become the Man Women Want is a book of advice about men’s sexual strategies published by Little, Brown, and Company. Max in November 2014, Max published his experience of working with Melissa Gonzalez who is the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the Lionesque Group for her book The Pop-Up Paradigm. This was the first project of his company Scribe Media.</p><p>Scribe Media was founded by Zach Obront and Max. The company writes and publishes books for entrepreneurs who wish to have their own book but don’t have the time, ability, or patience to do it the conventional way. Max stepped aside from day-to-day decisions after launching the company. He hired JT McCormick who is an author to serve as CEO in his place. Max in the year 2017 ghostwrote Tiffany Haddish’s memoir, The Last Black Unicorn. It was released in December 2017. It debuted at number 15 on The New York Times best-seller list.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=tucker-max-controversies></span><span>Tucker Max Controversies</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Max raised a lot of controversies when he posted on his website account in the year 2003 of his relationship with Katy Johnson. Katy was in Miss Vermont in 1999. Katy filed a lawsuit claiming invasion of her privacy among other things. A Florida state court judge, in response to that, issued an order for Max not to write about Johnson. He was as well told to neither use her second, first, “Miss Vermont” or full name on his website. He was as well ordered not to disclose any “information” or “stories” about Johnson. Some people called the decision “kooky” and “clearly a suppression of free speech”.</p><p>The case was too far that The ACLU had to intervene. They filed an amicus brief. They claimed that the decision was a breach of Max’s First Amendment rights. This led to Johnson voluntarily withdrawing her lawsuit. His story was again posted on his website. An expanded version of the story was later published in Hilarity Ensues. Max in January 2006, posted a thread on his message board satirizing Anthony DiMeo. Anthony DiMeo is a young Philadelphia socialite.</p><p>He satirized Anthony for throwing a New Year’s Eve party that was a disaster. The party was attended by many young partygoers showing who greatly exceeded expectations. This resulted in the food and alcohol running out well before midnight. The partygoers got unruly. Two pieces of art were stolen at the party. The police had to be called in order to disperse the crowd. Anthony was angry with Max’s comments and sued him under the Violence Against Women Act.</p><p>He claimed that Max’s message board was libelous and represented criminal behavior. With U.S. District Judge Stewart Dalzell the lawsuit was dismissed under the Communications Decency Act. Max in May 2009, held a speaking engagement that was picketed by a feminist group at Ohio State University. They claimed that his writing “promoted a culture of rape.” The North Carolina State University Women’s Center in August 2009, held a silent protest of I Hope They Serve Beer in Hell.</p><p>In multiple cities in the country, the advertisements were as well vandalized. In his book Trust Me, I’m Lying, marketer (and personal friend of Tucker Max) Ryan Holiday claimed to have defaced some movie posters himself, as a publicity stunt to get media attention for the movie. For three years starting in 2005, Max was harassed by a man named Justin Massler, who sent him repeated “Unabomber type” emails, and showed up uninvited to a 2006 party hosted by Max while dressed up as a superhero.</p><p>The altercations made national news after Massler was charged with stalking Ivanka Trump in 2010. In 2012, hoping to offset a part of his owed taxes in a way that also provided self-promotion, Max reportedly offered to donate $500,000 to Planned Parenthood if they named an abortion clinic after him. Planned Parenthood declined.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=tucker-max-bibliography></span><span>Tucker Max <span>Bibliography</span></span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><ul><li><strong>2001</strong>: The Definitive Book of Pick-Up Lines</li><li><strong>2003</strong>: Belligerence and Debauchery: The Tucker Max Stories</li><li><strong>2006</strong>: I Hope They Serve Beer in Hell</li><li><strong>2010</strong>: Assholes Finish First</li><li><strong>2012</strong>: Hilarity Ensues</li><li><strong>2012</strong>: Sloppy Seconds: The Tucker Max Leftovers</li><li><strong>2015</strong>: Mate: Become the Man Women Want, with Geoffrey Miller</li><li><strong>2017</strong>: The Last Black Unicorn</li></ul><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=tucker-max-filmography></span><span>Tucker Max Filmography</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><ul><li><strong>2009</strong>: I Hope They Serve Beer in Hell</li><li><strong>2009</strong>: I Hope They Serve Beer in Hell</li></ul><h2 style=text-align:center><span class=ez-toc-section id=frequently-asked-questions-about-tucker-max></span><span>Frequently Asked Questions About Tucker Max</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=who-is-tucker-max></span><span>Who is Tucker Max?</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Tucker Max is an <strong>American </strong>author as well as a public speaker.
