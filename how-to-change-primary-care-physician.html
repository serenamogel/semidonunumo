Your insurance company no longer contracts with your current doctor. This is actually as much a reason to <b>change</b> insurance companies as it is to <b>change doctors</b>.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-do-i-change-my-medical-provider></span>How do I change my medical provider?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>To change your <b>medical</b> plan, call <b>Health Care</b> Options at 1-800-430-4263 (TTY 1-800-430-7077). Or you can complete a <b>Medi-Cal</b> Choice Form. You can find the form on the Download forms page. Mail the completed choice form.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=does-my-new-doctor-need-my-medical-records></span>Does my new doctor need my medical records?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><b>NSW medical</b> practitioners <b>are</b> required to retain patients’ <b>records</b> for at least seven years from <b>the</b> date of <b>the</b> last entry. If a <b>patient</b> was younger than 18 at <b>the</b> date of <b>the</b> last entry, <b>the records</b> must be kept until <b>the patient</b> turns 25.
