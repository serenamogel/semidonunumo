According to The Standard, in Jerry Oppenheimer's book "<a href=#>The Kardashians: an American Drama</a>," Robert Kardashian told a friend that Presley's ex would even call her when they were "in bed" together.

As written by Oppenheimer, Kardashian's friend Joni Migdal shared that Kardashian persistently asked things of Presley that made her feel controlled. This was something she definitely did not want, having faced similar issues <a href=#>in her relationship with Elvis</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunB9k2xtb21nZL2ztdKcoKWkkWK9s7HSpZyyZaKkr6a%2B02aimqqUlsCptcCnZKygn6fBbrjIr5ydZaKkuqK6wp5m</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./latest-sci-fi-news-the-flash-costume-design-sparks-outrage-on-social-media-and-this-villain-teases-a-glorious-return-in-the-mandalorian-season-3.html><span>←</span><span>Latest Sci-Fi News: The Flash costume design sparks outrage on social media and this villain t</span></a>
