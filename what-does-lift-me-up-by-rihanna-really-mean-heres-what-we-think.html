"She was sitting over there," he said. "I was like, 'I see you, girl, but I'm not going to let you know that I saw you.'" We can't help but wonder what RiRi would say to Boseman if he were alive today, and songwriter Tems had a similar idea in mind when she penned "Lift Me Up" with co-writers Rihanna, Ludwig Göransson, and director Ryan Coogler.</p><p dir=ltr>Tems told <a href=#>Complex</a> that "Lift Me Up" is <a href=#>a tribute to Boseman</a>, who died in 2020 from <a href=#>colon cancer</a>. "I wanted to write something that portrays a warm embrace from all the people that I've lost in my life," the singer-songwriter explained. "I tried to imagine what it would feel like if I could sing to them now and express how much I miss them."</p><p dir=ltr>Some of the poignant <a href=#>lyrics</a> describe the profound pain and loneliness of loss using vivid imagery. "Burning in a hopeless dream," Rihanna sings. Another verse begins with the words, "Drowning in an endless sea." She seems to plead with the love she's lost, imploring them to "Keep me safe / Safe and sound." She also repeats the lyric "Hold me" — two words that many of us who have experienced loss would love to say to our departed loved ones.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamhnaoJ5f46wn5qsXZm8pr%2BMpaCfrF2ism7Bz2aZsmWinrWius2aZKudkaG5unnMnpinZZiav6a%2FjLCfmqxdrLJuwMeipaRn</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./robbie-gee.html><span>←</span><span>Robbie Gee Biography, Facts &amp;amp; Life Story</span></a>
